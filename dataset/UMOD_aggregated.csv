cag71xz	I believe he spends too much time playing battlefield 3, the current game that plays for about 1-3 hours a day. Although he gets As in his classes and has a good social life, as well as the fact he is physically healthy, I believe that he spends too much time looking at that bright, flashing screen (although he does not *appear* hyperactive) to have a good developing brain. I think that he can definitely handle the game's gruesome parts, though it has an M rating, and I am not concerned about that. His argument is that he gets his schoolwork done and is healthy and happy, but I believe that he is not truly happy because he spends too much time playing these games.	So whats you're argument that he's spending too much time playing it?

cfnizwe	Salary is based off of demand and how much the market can afford. Sports generate *a lot* of money, therefore, they earn a lot of money. This is true for any market. This is why actors get paid a lot. They generate tons of money from movies and shows. The more money your industry generates, the more money you make. 	I like this answer.

I didn't hear many arguments about brainwashing and abandoning children in the gay marriage debate. There are a lot of behaviors which are not considered normal and do not have a documented link to abuse, like furries. Similarly, if we normalized sex with children I don't think that would decrease the amount of abuse. The normalness of behavior is one of many factors and is not outcome-determinative.

I'm saying that pushing a group underground leaves that group ripe to abuse and be abused. Partners today are already slow to report abuse, I'd wager it'd be slower if the victim also faced arrest. (when you bring the child sex argument into the equation, please remember that the same types of arguments were used by awful bigots against same-gender marriage. You should be mindful to tread lightly.) Furries can take off their ourfits. It's really hard to hide your husband (gay or straight), or your husbands (gay or straight, plural). If we normalize plural relationships we can help victims. If normalized I'd wager they'd have similar rates of abuse to other households."	0.7283421195324062	0.8112781244591328	3.0	1.875	3.25	neutral	0.625	6	0.449	0.50388885	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	3	3	2	9	0.75	expert	1
caujut4	"First off, definitions. By price discrimination, I am referring to the practice of offering discounts or different prices to select groups. For example: a student discount on software or a bus ride, reduced prices for seniors at a movie theatre, ladies night drink prices at a bar, ""children-eat-free-tuesdays"", etc. Now, I understand the rationale behind this type of business model. By segmenting the market based on disposable income, it is possible to increase profits. There may even be other benefits (i.e. giving women an incentive to attend your bar or club could increase overall sales). However, I feel that it should be the right of any customer, regardless of market demographic, to be able to demand the lowest price. Anything else is unfair and wrong. CMV!"	The thing is different people are willing to spend different amounts on the same service/good. The amount of price people are willing to pay forms a bell curve. Once you set a price you are serving all people on one side of the line and are totally denying service to everyone on the other side of the line. The people who are paying are happy since they are paying a price they are comfortable with or even cheaper. Those people who are unwilling to pay your cost and are not served at all and are unhappy. Price discrimination allows you to address the needs of those people. You offer them a slightly inconvenient coupon that is only good on Wednesday and now the price is lowered for them so that they are willing to pay. They're happy, everyone paying the normal price is happy, and you're happy. It's win/win/win. If you disallow price discrimination you would never serve the needs of these people. If you lowered the price for everyone then you end up losing money from all those people who are perfectly happy with the normal price.	0.6143753308248358	0.7642045065086203	3.333333333333333	1.1111111111111112	4.333333333333333	neutral	0.6666666666666666	7	0.449	0.50388885	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	2	3	9	0.7777777777777778	expert	0
calmzrr	It seems to me that as more and more smartphones are released, along with them come a new slew of apps and social networking tools. Examples of this would be BBM's among blackberries, or apps like Tinder that are available only on the iOS. With every new app or phone feature, a community is created by its users, and this community is undoubtedly stronger the larger that it is. In the case of Tinder, for example, the app is worthless if its user base is small, but can be a pivotal networking tool if widespread. So it's obvious to me that even if a company like Nokia implements some brand new networking tool or app that's better than any other of its kind, if it's not available and used by a large user group, it's just not worth it. Essentially, I think it's always the most socially beneficial to own the most popular product, and this can even be applied to other products, not just phones. I know there must be an alternative to this thinking, but I can't wrap my head around it. Change my view?	&>>I believe that the phone that is most beneficial to own is the one that most other people own. CMV This seems like an obvious statement.

cp0tsgv	Your example with Parks and Recreations isn't the best one, because the episode mocked feminist organizations just as much. Now, I agree there's a tendency of the more outspoken feminists on the internet to ignore or even dismiss men-related issues, but I think a movement like feminism geared toward men would never work because the idea behind feminism is fighting opression. Men deal with a lot of crap, but how much of it comes from being considered a lesser type of human? Feminism in its best form is about getting women at the same level as men, men's rights in its best form is about making men's lives better. I'm all for both ideas, but when people start comparing the situations I have a hard time taking them seriously.

These are things like disallowing denial of coverage for people with preexisting conditions, insuring the poor and unhealthy through exchanges, etc. I am of the belief that insurance companies will actually thrive under the new law. Everyone has to buy their product. They have an excuse to raise premiums, since the individual mandate will likely cut down on adverse selection by pushing ""young healthies"" into the risk pool.

"While the ACA is written in the way you describe (Obama specifically met with the leadership of many insurance companies in order to ensure they would be on board), it nevertheless poses an existential risk for insurance companies. Right now, our health care system is a kludge of insurance-based, government-provided, and self-pay. The ACA increasingly penalizes the self-pay category, which in the short run drives them towards the insurance-based category. However, there is a strong possibility that eliminating the self-pay category will eliminate many of the remaining market incentives in the system, resulting an increased drive towards single-payer health care. Simultaneously, the government will be able to regulate health insurance plans more and more heavily - it currently imposes extra requirements on ""bare bones"" insurance and taxes ""Cadillac"" insurance - encouraging more and more uniformity until the companies' products look identical to government coverage. This also helps forge a potential path towards single-payer health care. This is how Obama sold the plan to progressives, certainly - and I don't think anyone knows how it will actually play out.

But there's so much competition there, and there's no money in it unless you get widely known.

cb92ye5	I believe this should happen as to help resolve gang violence, boasting about their crimes, hate tattoos and offensive tattoos towards police or anyone else. The tattoos should be filled in so it just shows a completely solid color or have them removed completely with surgery (Obviously that would be expensive). This will be all over the body including back, neck, chest, face etc. There are too many tattoos showing off the violence they've done and the carnage they have caused or just showing what gang they are in. If this was to be removed then I believe it will reduce the crimes within prisons. I do not believe it would be invading their human rights so far that it would be considered unfair as they are only allowed basic human rights when sent to prison in the first place. Anything more is ignored. Prisoners would be checked upon entering prison and routine checks would be made for tattoos made within the prison walls monthly. Do you think I am right or wrong with a thought like this, if not, change my view. Regards Jack Edit: This would also include removal of symbols representing something offensive/boastful as well.

cdmum67	You know how many people it takes to make 20 ATMs? Or to maintain (yes, you mentioned that), refill and unload, upgrade, program, and clean 20 ATMs? You know how ATMs are made? They use factories, and somewhat specialized machinery to produce. People work at those machines, and maintain them, and clean them. People run the factories, and other people build and own them. (there's plenty of rabbit-hole left to go down if you don't get the idea yet...)	What happens when we fully automate factories, and lose those jobs to automation and technology? Not long ago, you might need 5 Linux sysadmins to manage 1000 servers. Now with tools like puppet or cfengine you need 2. The basic point is that technology and automation will remove available jobs, and they will not be replaced by other 'more skilled' jobs.

cn1r9a8	I agree with your concern. Whether or not our workforce will have the skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Thats valid. But my point is also valid. For the 100 data entry jobs that no longer exist, there is not going to be 100 jobs in data storage/efficiency, high performance computing, etc. For the 100 jobs that were replaced, perhaps 50 new jobs emerged in these new fields. And my point is that as this trend continues, repeated hundreds of time over as technology and productivity and efficiency improve, you get more jobs replaced with less jobs that may or may not be more technical or different. Eventually, in 100% efficiency, all real work is automated.	I understand your concern that this trend eventually will lead to the concept of a job becoming obsolete. But I don't agree that we're losing jobs at even nearly that rate. Do you have any data to support that available jobs are disappearing at 50%? Considering there's only been a slight upward trend in unemployment in the US over the past 50 years, I really doubt this is the case. I also think you should consider that the creation of a new industry does not necessarily wipe out the old one. For example, cloud computing is a relatively new industry that's risen quickly in the past 5 years but it hasn't replaced the software industry. Instead, cloud computing delivers applications in a way that traditional software can't, but still serves the same purpose.

"The word ""gender"" actually does mean social identity rather than biological.

They were recently accepted into medical school. I do not have faith in his ability to be a fair, unbiased medical doctor that is more concerned with the best way to treat his patient, rather than furthering a personal agenda. In addition, I think understanding evolution and biological concepts in contrast to their beliefs is a major issue that prevents their understanding of the human body.

EDIT - or if I'm missing some argument you make, which is important because my problem with this argument is that the premises don't imply the conclusion. * Premise 1: Men are forced to pursue women in order to have sex. * Premise 2: Women therefore have more opportunities to have sex, particularly if they are attractive. * Conclusion: The culture looks down on women who accept more of these opportunities. Even if you agree with the premises, I really don't see how you get from the premises to the conclusion.	I would say: Premise 1: Both men and women desire sex. Premise 2: Most men have to pursue a woman in order to have sex, whereas most women do not have to pursue men in order to have sex; i.e., they are pursued. Premise 3: An attractive man may pursue five women and receive five rejections, whereas an attractive woman may receive five appeals and simply has to choose one. Premise 4: Women are not objects and deserve to express their sexual desires. Conclusion: An attractive woman who wants to have sex can express her sexual desires and have sex without having to pursue anyone; i.e., without really working for it at all; i.e. by abusing the system. Again, I don't support these views, I'm just trying to tease out the logic. Is that a little bit clearer?

When a European individual or political party wishes to limit the number of immigrants it takes in, or wants a more homogeneous society, they are instantly and viciously pounced on and attacked by the left. They will be accused of all manner of horrible things for expressing such an opinion. However, these same leftists never criticize Japan, despite being a first-world nation that pretty much doesn't allow immigration at all and has an almost entirely homogeneous society.

The market will respond to the decrease in the size of the labor force and raise wages. The liberal solution tends to be: go after the employers that exploit illegal immigrant labor to remove the incentive to immigrate illegally while giving a path to citizenship to the ones that already built lives here. As for Japan, the reason nobody really cares about their racism, is that there isn't anyone there for them to oppress. It isn't hurting anyone. If Japan had an illegal immigration problem, and they were treating those people poorly, then it would be an issue, but there aren't any immigrants.

All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business.

However, I think it's perfectly reasonable and honestly more practical for companies to be closed-source. Quite simply, it's their goddamn intellectual property.

Would you say an author should allow anyone to change his/her work? Would you say he/she should submit it to the public for free just because you can't afford it?

cftr0xk	Let me be as clear as possible: I’m talking only about the Army, the main branch of the United States Armed Forces, responsible for land-based military operations. I think that U.S. should keep other military branches (Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard) as they are. The equipment (tanks, guns…) and the personnel of the current Army should be allocated to U.S. states, so that they can incorporate them into state National Guards. That way the ability to defend the country in case of a foreign invasion would not be diminished, but it would reduce the ability of the federal government to wage imperialistic wars around the world. As we know, “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. That’s why we have separation of political powers (into legislature, executive, and judiciary) and a balance of power between U.S. state governments and the federal government. I think military power should have separation as well. (I gave an example of U.S. Army, but similar argument could be made for other countries with strong militaries, too).	I kinda like this idea. We really don't have proper militias anymore.

cdky6vv	Your first point is wrong, Lincoln had plenty of chances to fuck up during his two terms, but he kicked ass instead. Lincoln defeated better known and more experienced candidates to become president, pretty much raised an army from scratch (because there were a lot of rebels, and spies, in the current army), produced the Emancipation Proclamation to a North weary of war and VERY worried about blacks taking northern jobs, deftly kept European powers (many of whom were highly dependent on cotton) from entering into the fray, extended the Civil War when the South and MANY northerners wanted to have peace so that he could ensure that the 13th amendment could be passed, and oh yeah, kept the country together and won a Civil War which the South pretty much only had to not lose in order to win (the north had to overwhelm while the South could have dragged it out). The majority of scholars consider him to be the best president http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States Who are these scholars you allude to? 	Oh he was a great man no doubt, the point was just that he might have been seen in a different light if he was president during ordinary peace time and not a war leader. The nationalism of the time and the fact he was on the victorious side gives some bias to his image. And the North did have the upper hand in the war. The South had some advantage from fighting a defensive war, but it's not terribly surprising the North won (though hindsight bias is probably responsible for that.)	0.4816144479572713	0.9182958340544896	2.6666666666666665	1.6666666666666667	3.4444444444444446	neutral	0.6666666666666666	6	0.449	0.50388885	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	4	3	9	0.6666666666666666	GPT	0

cl2qexg	I am not sure I agree that the show is meant to help the restaurant succeed. Their primary goal is entertainment, they often berate people and do pretty static re-designs of their restaurants. The restaurants they visited had no higher chance of being pulled out of failure than restaurants they didn't visit, according to one article. It's very possible that the reason he felt so bad about it was because his failure was suddenly much more public and the blame had been pinned on him by the TV show. At least if your restaurant fails without that you can always blame other factors, the economy, the location, unexpected cultural shifts. But when someone comes up to you and says it's your fault if the restaurant sinks to the bottom of the Hudson, then when it fails you jump into said Hudson (a statistically unlikely way to commit suicide) I think it's tough to just brush off the show as having had no impact.	But the show really does help many restaurants. His criticisms help them address shortcomings, and the name Ramsay alone helps them relaunch. I've visited one whilst on holiday without realising it, simply because it's a unique feature to have his name attached to a restaurant in a given area, so if you've no idea where to eat you simply opt in favour of that one, assuming it looks half decent.

Non-straight children would still have access to erotic literature and websites discussing sexuality, which I feel would be a lot more helpful to them than porn. I may be biased though, because I really dislike most porn in general and feel that it does more harm than good.	I agree with everything you say. I guess I've never watched gay porn, so I couldn't say for sure whether its likely to be as damaging as straight porn but I've read *about* gay porn in academic literature and it certainly doesn't seem like a panacea for a young individual confused about their sexuality.

c9snj52	I think a lot more people are addicted to porn than will care to admit. I think this because I see a lot of threads around the internet where people are trying to stop using porn for the longest time possible, and most do not last more than a couple weeks. I think that porn has a negative effect on your sexual life, since it teaches you unrealistic expectations for sex with your partner.	"There are a lot of things that can wreck a relationship, but ultimately it's not the government's job to be your relationship counsellor. Pornography is a form of speech, and free speech is protected by the first amendment. You'd need to show a much greater harm than ""it teaches you unrealistic expectations for sex with your partner"" to justify abridging the first amendment. Also, regulation of porn would be virtually impossible. The government already regulates it (can't sell to children under 18) but the internet makes a mockery of that. So unless the US government starts limiting the internet to the extent that North Korea does, you won't be able to limit porn. Finally, porn may actually help relationships because a guy can just put on a porno and jack off if he's feeling horny and his significant other isn't around/in the mood. Better that than he goes out and cheats.

The problem is that it's so tightly integrated into the OS that any vulnerability found in IE exposes Windows to possible problems to the entire system. 	0.3567745915241628	0.9852281360342516	4.142857142857143	2.2857142857142856	3.571428571428572	neutral	0.7142857142857143	5	0.4817143	0.5402857	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	1	2	7	0.4285714285714285	negative	0
cfvskc5	The very rich may see their taxes dropped, yes. I don't see that as a bad thing because in this system the incentive is to stop them from hiding their money in complicated tax schemes and overseas tax havens but rather to invest it here in America building factories, franchises, retail outlets, and the like. It's a fallacy to think that if something benefits the wealthy it does so at the expense of anyone else. As I stated in the OP, I don't think the system is perfect, but I do believe it provides a stronger economic incentive for investment and growth domestically and captures revenue from other sources such as tourism and black market money when that money comes to purchase goods retail.	If your Fairtax is going to raise as much revenue as the current tax code, and the wealthy pay billions less, it's not a fallacy to say this is at the expense of others. It literally means others will be paying billions more. Plus, with the middle class being taxed to death, and on top that, having a gigantically huge disincentive to purchase goods, why the heck would anyone use their savings to invest in America? Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to invest in countries where people still had money to buy things and weren't sodomized by the tax code when they did?	0.9125783836813872	0.9852281360342516	3.4285714285714284	2.7142857142857144	3.4285714285714284	negative	0.7142857142857143	4	0.4817143	0.5402857	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	2	4	1	7	0.5714285714285714	expert	0

MSPA isn't completely different than other forms of art, it is merely one of the extremes and thus a very clear example.

In the case of mspa, audience participation is clearly part of the artist's vision. So it intrinsically can't change the artist's vision.

cfxi51t	I acknowledge there are exceptions (and thank you for pointing them out, by the way) but none of them really address the problem. The general scenario that I envision as being most problematic is the one where a police officer conducts a search of either an individual's premises or person believing that they have sufficient probable cause, finding incriminating evidence of a crime - let's use possession of drugs, because it's probably the most common instance, but it could equally apply to, for example, robbery, assault, murder etc - but when the matter is brought to trial it is excluded on the basis that the officer was wrong. None of the exceptions address this issue; nor does the execution of the search (in my view) provide any ground for excluding evidence rather than just reprimanding the officer. The current doctrine doesn't serve the apparent intent of the 4th Amendment.

coy40uw	For a moment lets take Yugoslavia breaking up as an example to illustrate what I'm trying to say, but I'll change it a bit. Lets say that in 1991 Slovenia wasn't one of the federal republics and that the in June a referendum took place and people voted in favor of joining Yugoslavia. Considering that, I can guarantee that the same exact thing would happen, the West wouldn't tolerate Slovenia joining the federation because it wouldn't be in their interest to see Yugoslavia expand. Immediately a familiar response in terms of sanctions and media coverage would follow. What if those people in eastern Ukraine actually want to join Russia? Are you going to tell me that Putin somehow made all those people living there disappear and replaced them with russian soldiers?	"The difference is instead of allowing it to be a purely internal movement driven by the desires of the majority Russia stepped in and made it an international issue.

I believe that the person who comes out of the machine is me in every practical way, as I do not believe in an external soul. Consequently, I wouldn't mind doing risky activities, having myself recreated at a destination and then killing the first copy, or trying risky activities with the machine as an insurance policy. I believe this for several reasons. One, what defines a person is the pattern in which they are organized. Whether or not the pattern is composed out of *these* atoms or *those* atoms is irrelevant to me. Secondly, I am going to die. My stream of consciousness will be interrupted no matter what I do.

I certainly understand the struggle of the trans person, but at some point, it just defeats the entire purpose of having gender-specific facilities in the first place.	Realistically, that likely would not happen. For one, trans women that haven't started transitioning yet are unlikely to go into the women's lockerroom. It's safe to say that an untransitioned trans woman that's going to go into a locker room is going to take pretty much any and all possibly steps to make sure that nobody sees her penis. Trans people that use locker rooms pretty much always try to draw little attention to themselves and really don't want people knowing about their trans status in such setting.

That is simply not true. Some kids will grow up to be less successful than others, due to a variety of factors. I'm not saying we should discourage kids, but we should explain that some things will not work out.

By telling them that they all can do anything, we set them up to face a harsh truth later in life. "	Its a trade off. Convincing kids that they can do anything will allow them to shoot for very high goals and even if they don't reach them they'll work very hard and get much higher than they would without a strong motivation.

cewrjde	Well yes, as obviously countries do vary. But that doesn't make it arbitrary - that makes it's culturally based surely? As in, it's not been done 'without thought' but within what's considered right and wrong within a society. And in general you can pull a few generics from it; most cultures agree that consent can't happen until puberty. With many it coincides with other responsibilities - eg voting, driving, drinking, military service. But yes it does vary culture to culture. It's not designed to be perfect, but to prevent the worst from happening (such as manipulation and pedophilia) in a blanket way. But I'd argue that, while it seems arbitrary from a logical stand point, it is a reflection of the culture and further confirmation of their societal norms.	Yes and I see this creating stigmatization between different cultures. Take for example. Muhammed, the muslim prophet was 50 y.o and he married a 6 y.o who he later consummated when she was 9. If you tell this story to someone who lives in the US, they'll say he's a rapist. So we can go from Prophet to Rapist by making a half circle around the world.

clivbx5	This view is the basis for a business idea that I am trying to develop. Premise: Change the meaning of the word Hitler to something(anything) else by creating a product that fulfills a huge societal need, call that product, Hitlr. [Product Description](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2k7i2b/need_feedback_hitlr_a_new_kind_of_social_network/) It is my view that even the meaning of this word is not fixed, it can be changed, the negative connotation can be overcome. Evidence to this include Hitler satire like Hipster Hitler, Hitler cat memes, and the YouTube Downfall Parody Videos. Another way to think of my view is this: What if someone created a miracle drug, the cure for cancer, what if they named that drug rape? The meaning of the word would change, people wouldn't reject the drug because of the word. I am posting this view because I need someone to prove to me that the meaning of Hitler can't be changed, it can't become Hitlr: A New Kind of Social Network. CMV [/r/hitlr](http://www.reddit.com/r/hitlr/)	Hitler isn't just some evil dictator, he is THE evil dictator. In fact he is popularly considered the pinnacle of evil, or evil incarnate.

But because Hitler is the pinnacle example of a concept that is fundamental to human nature, even should your product be the pinnacle product, it would still never eclipse him.

cjuzsu9	Somewhere else on reddit a police officer said there was nothing weird about the 6 shots. That that's pretty normal because cops are trained to shoot until the suspect isn't moving (and I get the whole fear of life thing, but surely in this day and age we can train cops to shoot kneecaps or something--that sounds horrible but at least it's not fatal) and that bullets in real life aren't as effective as on tv. One tiny bullet isn't taking down a giant. I usually have a hate-on for cops. That said, I think this is a thorny case. If it happened in a less racist place I might be firmly on the pd's side but after reading about Ferguson's police problems--like the mistaken identity case--it appears this is just the straw that broke the camel's back.

Going back to my post before your response, your premise is that (with relation to evolutionary adaptation and survival of the gene pool) the marginal utility of having a greater desire to mate brought about by an individual's heterosexuality is greater than the marginal utility of other adaptive advantages that homosexuality may bring, while foregoing some degree of desire to mate.

Lots of things are bad for you but enjoyable. Fast food, certain sports, etc. The problem is that alcohol and tobacco is that they are addictive, and people suffering from addiction have a reduced capacity to make rational decisions regarding the object of their addiction. Pot is not addictive in the same way that those drugs are. Yes, it's a psychoactive substance, but so what? Why does that make it something that ought to be banned?

caaapu4	I think this would kill a lot of small family businesses, which hurts everyone. I have a family member who runs a dance studio started by her mother. It employs about a dozen dance teachers, and ownership is split between the founder and her daughter. The business does okay, but I'm pretty sure I make way more as a software architect than the owners take home. The founder is currently dying of ALS. If her daughter had to purchase the other half back from the government after the founder's death, it would create enough of a financial burden that it would probably make more sense to shut down the business than buy back the other half. Nobody wins in this scenario. The founder's daughter loses the business she's grown up with. The other employees lose their jobs. The customers have less competition among local dance studios. The government loses out on future tax revenue the business might have generated, in exchange for whatever they can get selling the property that no longer has a productive business associated with it.	&amp;#8710; This is a worthwhile point, sorry about your family member. Do you think that the business would be worth more than $5.25 million? I feel like this is probably the reason that the cutoff is currently so high (IMO), with the fallout from hurting small businesses being scary enough to politicians. Now that I've looked into it a bit it seems like this is extremely unlikely to happen with the current cutoff/system, as there are deductions and safeguards written in to avoid needing to liquidate, including one that allows payment of the tax over 15 years at low interest rates, so I still think the cutoff should be much lower than it is now. 	0.3688185682915278	0.9852281360342516	4.0	1.0	4.428571428571429	neutral	0.7142857142857143	7	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	1	2	7	0.5714285714285714	expert	0

I think the crux of my belief is that we all want the faults of the current system to be changed but it's far too hard for an outsider to do it unless they planned on dismantling the system, a process that the vast majority of Americans are against. So if any change happens it has to come from within and you can't do that as an outsider.	http://drupal6.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/286469/status-report-obama-s-judicial-confirmations-ed-whelan Obama has been fairly successful, compared to Bush, at getting his nominees to the judicial bench. And a third party candidate would likewise have a great deal of power to appoint members of the judicial system and bureaucracy that supported their goals. They could likewise write executive orders to enact large scale changes. On enacting legislative goals, that is a job for the legislators, not the president. The president can offer some reassurances, but they are (on purpose) limited in what they can do.	0.3688185682915278	0.9852281360342516	3.571428571428572	1.5714285714285714	4.571428571428571	neutral	0.7142857142857143	5	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	4	2	1	7	0.5714285714285714	GPT	0

chz8o6k	"It is my view that philosophy is useless endeavor. The human mind is fallible, therefore it can not be used in isolation to determine any fundamental truths outside of ""I think therefore I am"". However, it can be used to conduct scientific experiments which determine truths about how the world actually works, and as a result science should be taught and philosophy excluded. Now I realize that this argument leaves out ethical philosophy, since human behavior can not be understood purely through science, so I guess that one could stay. But all the other types: epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics should be removed from educational curriculum. _____ "	Is the right to free speech important? Why?

I have a new computer coming soon with Windows 8.1 and I hear that it does something similar and I plan to create a fake account again for the same purpose.

But for the average guy who isn't going to backup all his documents onto a remote hard drive, it's a cheap and effective way to recover lost files from something like hard drive failure. It obviously also depends on the content of what you are storing. You are going to be less concerned about hackers raiding your online drive for family holiday photos than passwords.docx.

This only applies on college campuses of state controlled colleges. Private colleges are not bound by this at all which was my entire point. Indeed the decision repeatedly points this fact out that since the College is working in concert of state control it is bound by the first amendment, if not for the state control it would not be. Hate speech is not constitutionally protected on college campuses in general, it is only protected in the case of state controlled schools. Even further, if they take any actions which disrupt campus, then school is fully within it's rights to then shut the group down.

cd4p8t8	"I believe that networking being the most important part of finding a job (for example ""who you know is more important than what you know"") is terrible for people and terrible for the job market in general. Landing a job shouldn't be about who you know or the fact that you have some thin connection to a higher-up; it should be about being the most qualified or outstanding candidate for the job. The fact that networking gets many people into positions where they may not be the most qualified means that the better applicant's skills aren't being used. Today, knowing someone and using them as an entrance into a job field is more important than being more qualified. I have heard people say this in classes of mine as well as career seminars. I recognize that it is extremely important today and I have used this tactic to get a job, though I still think that it is wrong and detrimental. Merit should be the only factor in determining employment."	Well, networking isn't the most important but it helps a lot. Just knowing the boss won't get you a job you're completely unqualified for. However, networking is beneficial to the employer for at least two major reasons. 1.) It can provide more trust in the potential employee's abilities. Instead of hearing from a random guy that employee A is great and the best, I know personally (or at least from someone else who I trust) that employee B is great. It's much less risky to hire employee B rather than A 2.) It demonstrates a certain level of social abilities. Very few jobs take place in a vacuum; most involve other people and teamwork. Networking demonstrates that the employee can form professional relationships well. Also, some jobs require a certain amount of networking to complete but I assumed you weren't talking about those.	0.6238116528828437	0.863120568566631	3.571428571428572	1.2857142857142858	4.428571428571429	positive	0.7142857142857143	6	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	1	7	0.7142857142857143	GPT	0
cpo9tv7	I am a student who has been assigned the debate topic of the implementation of a carbon tax and I am very biased (and almost closed-minded) toward this side of the argument. I personally believe that the US should implement one. I believe that a carbon tax would encourage industry in the United States to move toward more energy efficient practices, and benefit America's energy consumption overall. I wanted to hear what others thought of this issue so I could be more well-rounded on the subject matter. It is important to know that the tax would only apply to industry and would not apply to the every-day American. All points-of-view are welcome and any sources are strongly encouraged.	How exactly does this do anything except put money in uncle sam's pocket? To produce carbon costs money as it is, business are always looking to cut down on more and more expenses, a better alternative is to provide something besides carbon to produce. Maybe instead offer tax breaks for companies that go solar, that will encourage growth, rather than a tax which always leads to less jobs. 	0.6351689735075925	0.863120568566631	4.142857142857143	1.7142857142857142	3.857142857142857	negative	0.7142857142857143	6	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	2	1	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0
cp8qlug	Instead of denial of re-entry, which is generally unconstitutional anywhere that has a constitution, why not just criminally charge them for treason and put them in prison? It seems to greatly reduce the risk of terrorism, since now they can't plot things from abroad either.	Under British law certainly, treason remains a difficult crime to actually prosecute and usually any attempt to prosecute a case sees charges downgraded to other lesser, but more easily convicted, crimes. Plus given the issues of radicalisation in prison, putting such people into the prison system is just asking for trouble unless Florence ADX-style prisons become the norm in the UK and Europe, where prisoners can be isolated. Plus the chances are such people who join iS aren't just going to become 'normal' again, meaning a massive cost to the taxpayer for their incarceration, which is likely going to be for life, because they'll likely never be safe for release. I would also take issue with the massive costs involved. Prison is expensive at the best of times, and assuming you did manage to secure a terrorism charge with decades of prison sentences, you're talking a cost of millions of pounds. 	0.8122154660298674	0.863120568566631	3.857142857142857	1.0	4.428571428571429	neutral	0.7142857142857143	7	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	0	2	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0

co2ze2a	BSC has more to do with producing fertile offspring than geographical isolation. Your example isn't really applicable.	That's true, but one of the problems with BSC to classify species is that it can be hard to test if two proposed species really are reproductively isolated or not. Also, two different species (but almost all definitions) can often produce hybrid offspring which sometimes can, to various degrees, produce fertile offspring. Thus, the point I'm getting at here, is that speciation is rarely a question of yes-or-no, black or white, it's often a question of gradation and trying to determine at what point the differences between two populations are enough to call them seperate species. Geographical isolation (or another type of isolation, though geographical is often the easiest to understand) preventing reproduction between two populations is a big aspect that leads into two species eventually becoming reproductively isolated. 	0.3703924980132491	0.9852281360342516	3.0	1.0	4.142857142857143	neutral	0.7142857142857143	7	0.4817143	0.5402857	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	0	3	7	0.4285714285714285	negative	0

And warming of 4°C would almost certainly kick off natural positive feedback mechanisms that would cause warming to continue up to 12°C.

cd74uwt	"I'll start out by saying that I own a gun, and I enjoy shooting as a sport. I don't feel strongly one way or another on the issue of gun control. However, one argument repeatedly advanced by redditors and gun control opponents goes likes this: Pro-Control: ""We should have gun control laws; they'll limit who can get guns."" Anti-Control: ""What's the point? A criminal is going to break the law anyway."" Using this logic, that laws restricting gun ownership won't work (or will have slim margins of success) because criminals are going to ignore them, one must ultimately conclude that no criminal law ought to be enacted since they won't stop the crimes they address. For example, enacting a speed limit is pointless because speeders are still going to speed; statutes proscribing assault are pointless because people are going to assault others; *ad infinitum*. I don't see how this claim (gun laws won't work, therefore don't enact them) can logically exist with other criminal penalties. Please CMV!"	I'm not arguing one way or the other, but there seems to be a slight misunderstanding of an important component of the gun control debate here. No one can logically assert that making guns illegal would instantly reduce gun related deaths--or even significantly reduce them for many years. However, in the long view, rates *would* go down, and stay down as the supply of guns plummets within a generation or two. Now, I know that crime will just shift and blah blah blah--I'm not advocating one course or the other. Just pointing out that gun deaths would go down in the long term.	0.9371660954010518	0.5916727785823275	2.857142857142857	1.4285714285714286	4.571428571428571	neutral	0.7142857142857143	8	0.4817143	0.5402857	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	0	1	7	0.8571428571428571	expert	0

cl03mwh	You realize you are swapping the burden of proof here? The burden lies on the person making the claim of existence, not the other way around. It is almost impossible to prove something, regardless of what subject we are talking about, does not exist. Doesn't mean it is likely or unlikely, just proving nonexistence is a monumental task. Doesn't matter if you're talking poker theorems or mythological creatures or aliens. Proving nonexistence is nigh impossible. 	I don't fully agree with that. I think that it is different in mathematics. Let's say x is a tallest person on earth. It is not impossible to prove that there doesn't exist a person that is taller than x. It is trivial right? Also it's not hard to prove that there doesn't exist (for example) a fully connected graph with n-2 vertices (n = number of nodes). So ya.

ch2xusi	&>> If employee safety is in the best interest of a company, why did labor have to fight so hard for government safety regulations in the workplace? This is irrelevant. The status quo was changed and that's all that matters, and so now it is in the best interest of the company to act as I suggest.

Sorry, I've never been one to subscribe to advertising at any point in my life, even when I was a kid. I've only ever been annoyed by advertisements and so I don't find your argument that advertising is as motivating as you suggest to be a reality. 	So you're comfortable with the government creating regulations for companies in order to force said companies to be more responsible for the safety/health of employees and consumers? Me too. And it's not like saying companies are evil because of child labor practices at the turn of the century. It's saying that companies will do whatever it takes to make a profit and the government has an important role to play as the buffer between that desire for profit and practices that may not be in the best interest of the employees of a company or the consumer. As for your claim about the unimportance of advertising, either you or wrong or those in charge of nearly every major corporation on earth are wrong, because most of the biggies spend billions--with a b--in advertising annually.

ckb4tlv	Out of curiosity, what makes you think that an adult human's desire to live is more developed than that of a baby's or animal's when literally *all* the scientific evidence points to the contrary? Studies have shown that animals as simple as crustaceans are capable of experiencing pain in a way not fundamentally different from the way humans experience pain, and plenty of tests have confirmed that all kinds of mammals and certain birds have self-awareness. Luminaries as authoritative as Jane Goodall agree that we are not fundamentally a different class of creature from other animals - that we experience the world basically in equivalent terms. What is the basis of your argument to the contrary? What makes you think the human being wants to live more than, say, a chimp or a bear? Everything I have seen in the world has taught me that the desire to live is a basic, animal instinct - not anything derived from higher-order human-only cognition.	Maybe it is less wrong to kill an infant than it is to kill a pig (in a vacuum, so to speak) I'm uncertain as to the specifics. I admit that is quite possible, if not probable. However, I think the active desire to continue existing is unique to animals capable of abstract thought, and most of the time it is a desire to avoid unpleasant stimuli that drives the survival behaviour of most animals.	0.2058948278308588	0.9852281360342516	4.142857142857143	1.4285714285714286	3.2857142857142856	neutral	0.7142857142857143	6	0.4817143	0.5402857	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	2	5	0	7	0.5714285714285714	expert	0

ch9j9hd	If I told you 700 years ago that the whole universe was made of energy that was so small you couldn't see it, you would think I was irrational and there would be no way to prove the existence of atoms. Many things that are true seem to defy conventional logic, and new discoveries are made. 	Decent point, but my only problem with that argument is that the first premise (That the whole universe is made of energy so small that we couldn't see it) is physically testable and we could prove/disprove it. Obviously not with the technology 700 years ago, but it would have been theoretically provable. And the large majority of theists I have talked to have said how it would be impossible to physically test for the existence of god and prove he exists. Even if that wasn't the case, we don't have the technology now, and therefor no evidence now.

cfdjriw	"Hey, to get this out of the way: I hold no grudge against gays and they may have all rights that they want. There is recently some football player who just came out of the closet and of course there have been a lot retiring athletes who said they are gay. And everyone on the internet attacks the other athletes if they say that they would ""feel uncomfortable around gays"". I think they have the right to do so. We are often seperating men and women in showers and locker rooms. My understanding is, that for one point, we are doing this because the other gender could be attracted and that would make persons feel uncomfortable. People staring at genitals and stuff. So if we don't allow men and women to do all this stuff together - why should we allow gay people? I know that this would cause a lot of problems (bisexual locker rooms?! gay locker rooms?!) and would almost be unsolvable, BUT I believe that athletes have a point in saying they feel uncomfortable around gays just as they would around women. "	I think this was asked earlier but I'll have a stab at it. I think the problem with men and women sharing locker rooms is that the differences are glaring. With homosexuality you might not even know there's a gay guy in your locker room. It only becomes uncomfortable when you become aware. There's a certain degree of arrogance when it comes to certain straight men about homosexuals that just because he's gay he must be interested, not only in their penis, but in everyone's penis. The truth being that gay and straight men have shared the same spaces of being undressed for centuries. And in these places in particular these people are professionals. There's 100% likelihood that any gay person within that locker room is thinking about the game more than they give a shit about someone's cock.	0.0800553165589084	0.9852281360342516	4.142857142857143	2.571428571428572	3.571428571428572	negative	0.7142857142857143	4	0.4817143	0.5402857	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	0.4285714285714285	expert	0
cfi7bul	I don't think it should be the role of government to protect people from their own stupidity. For example, if someone wants to ride a bicycle or motorcycle without a helmet or ride in a car without a seat belt, that should be their right. Note however that I specifically mean laws that only protect someone from their OWN stupidity. I still think that it should be illegal to drive while talking on a cell phone or with an unrestrained animal (Such as your little dog) in the car, because those people are driving distracted which could case them to crash into an innocent bystander. I think society would be better off if the type of person that doesn't wear a seat belt or helmet would just die off. Change my view.	Does this include stupidity that you have to pay for?

ckxoltm	If the corporation is separate though then how are the owners' rights being infringed upon? That's like saying because Tom and Jerry got married my right to religious is infringed upon. No it isn't they are different people. If the corporation isn't separate then we have just destroyed the concept of corporations and contracts are with the person who owns it not the legal entity.	The corporations mentioned are not just any corporations--they're closely-held ones. If you were already married to Tom, your rights would be infringed by Tom and Jerry's marriage. That's what we're saying here. I'm going to copy/paste an answer I gave [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2hzyl1/cmv_corporate_personhood_i_think_14th_amendment/ckxoda7): &>> There's an in-between step missing in your view. It's not black and white like that. The corporation can be separate in some instances while still receiving benefits from being closely held. In my opinion, this is better than keeping the owner and corporation entirely separate, since it allows legal flexibility for situations just like this one!	0.3053288450770561	0.9910760598382222	3.4444444444444446	2.0	4.0	positive	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5017778	0.43322223	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	3	2	4	9	0.5555555555555556	expert	0
chgqg6a	It's astonishing how many words you managed to put into my mouth. I never said anything about how people use the term feminism, I was referring to the distinction between academic feminism and popular feminism in the same way I might academic and popular science. One of them is far more nuanced and far more accurate than the other, but it is not necessarily the one people are most familiar with. Nowhere did I claim that the concept of patriarchy I put forward comes from popular feminism, but rather that expecting me to incorporate every single competing theory from feminist thought into a reddit post is a bit much. Nowhere did I claim that there were not other theories of patriarchy, or other intersectional models. Really, the only one I see here fighting a strawman is you. 	"academic feminism tends to be derived from lit crit ideas that have little merit like postmodernism, asserts things like ""fluid mechanics is less understood than solid mechanics because fluids are more feminine"" and ""Principia Mathematica is a rape manual"".

cfoeeig	A popular media topic as of late is the assertion that people are interacting less because people are too obsessed with their smartphones. Eating establishments are offering discounts to parties who set their phones aside, to help maintain their atmosphere and people often cite that college students are interacting with their phones instead of their classmates. I personally find that people aren't socializing less they are merely socializing with people more relevant to them within their social circle. Anecdotally when im out eating i use my smart phone to carry the conversation, because the internet has plenty of topics to actually discuss. Also its a good way to end disputes at the bar via fact checking. I think this whole sentiment is blown out of proportion and just a popular controversial topic not really impacting anyone significantly CMV.

cclih4p	I am not saying interstellar aliens could not exist, or they couldn't get here if they existed. There is a statistical possibility that intelligent life existed or persists out in the cosmos, but I don't think they would be able to find our planet or even have any interest in the human race to visit it. But hoaxes false sightings and very intelligent people believing alleged employees of government agency's have clouded the waters, if alien life visited earth we would know, most likely to visit earth would be an unmanned spaceship that would unwrap and become a factory producing more of its kind and spreading throughout the universe. No 'evidence' or unusual activity by the states should be extrapolated to aliens when other more likely explanations should be accounted for first. One Roswell theory was the USSR crashed a disc shaped plane with disabled children into new mexico to start an alien conspiracy, which sounds crazy because it is, but at least that Occam's razors to be more likely then aliens crashes (these aliens need a better flight school I think).	"Now, I agree with you that all these ""sightings"" are [complete BS](http://xkcd.com/1235/). However, that's not to say that aliens haven't visited Earth. That's not to say they did, guaranteed, however... There's a theory called [Panspermia](http://www.space.com/5843-legged-space-survivor-panspermia-life.html) which states that it may be possible for life to travel from one planet to another in meteors. It's quite possible that the first life here came from Mars - we simply don't know enough about the history of life and evolution to be certain. Other theories say that the first organic molecules came from meteors, which then developed into life from there. Some theories are more likely than others, but the point is that we don't know - both theories are valid, and while I think that the latter is more likely, we don't know that. All of life on Earth could have evolved from initial life that came from Mars, or another meteor from a different star. So do I believe that aliens have visited Earth? My only answer can be maybe.

cig7y81	When the individual does not want to press the issue. The complaint we made was for when a district manager was treating her like she wanted to have sex with him when the friend told him that she did. I've advised her that she needs to press the issue. She keeps saying that she doesn't want to look like a trouble maker, everyone does it, and that she honestly believes nothing will be done if she did press the issue. What do you do in that position? How do you convey the idea that nothing would get resolved unless you push it anyways, and the one time she did attempt to press the issue, it made a huge mess that even made me think the entire thing was broken.	This still, to me, still does not sound like a problem that would magically be fixed by 50% female representation.

cc7yc75	I realize the obvious double standard here. I just think girls and boys are different. Why? Because I am a male and if a hot adult woman, say 26, wanted to have sex with me when I was 15 I don't think that would damage me in any way (besides STI or pregnancy). In fact, I think I would look back on it as being an awesome experience. Also, nearly all women will tell you that a grown man having sex with a 15 year old is gross and morally despicable, but in my experience nearly all men want to give the lad a pat on the back if he bagged an adult woman. We don't quite understand why the adult woman would want to bang a young boy, but we certainly don't feel bad for him. So, is there really a double standard here, or are there relevant differences? Just to be clear, I am not talking about sex with children. That is sickening. Just high school age teens. 	I'm someone around 15, and I can say that assumption is false. This 26 year old woman is not probably super desirable or attractive. This woman could and probably be an ugly slob who can't get laid legally with a man her own age. Would you want to still bang an ugly slob? I wouldn't. Now, let's take the opposite scenario. Girls in my school cannot shut up about Ryan Gosling. He's 32. Now, virtually all girls in my grade would nail Ryan Gosling. What I'm trying to say is, female to male rape isn't looked at as an issue, which is wrong. This lack of knowledge leads people like you to believe that it is desirable. It is not. Just like you picture a rapist to be some hot 26 year old doesn't mean it will be.

I was using the term profit as synonymous with the money that is left after your product and operating costs are taken out. The reason I say what I do is that people often seem to have this idea that nonprofits should be super cheap products because they only have to sell for cost price, and that's just not true.

The center of gravity shifts drastically, forward motion becomes difficult and the whole thing may eventually sink. Sex never enhances a teenage romance. Instead, it almost always overwhelms and stifles it. Arguments, secrecy, stress and guilt usually replace laughter, discovery and meaningful conversation. 	Are you simply arguing against sex among adolescents and people who don't fully grasp how to handle an adult relationship or against sex before marriage in general? Because to me it sounds more like you're arguing against the former. Sex among adolescents makes things way more complicated in a time when people are just learning how to be in relationships at all. I lost my virginity myself at 19 and I think it was probably too early then but I still don't regret it one bit because it was with someone I trusted at the time. Since then I've had relationships that were simply sexual and ones that were overall fulfilling and whether or not we had sex really didn't have much effect on the relationship at all. Currently I'm 26 and still unwed and sex has not complicated things for me in a very long time.	0.2040087622901335	0.9910760598382222	3.6666666666666665	1.4444444444444444	3.333333333333333	neutral	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5017778	0.43322223	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	5	2	2	9	0.5555555555555556	negative	0
cjwb2ej	I would define a dangerous area by the amount of dangerous crimes committed in it. A reason for that statistic might be that blacks generally commit quite a disproportionate percentage of crime in the U.S. Not to say some cops aren't racist. But anyway, displayed blatantly and without care it might ramp it up, but concealed then no. Also, how exactly would you deescalate a fire fight that suddenly popped up on patrol in a dangerous area without firepower yourself? Or if you were attacked by drug dealers you came upon? Or some similar random situation in which a criminal with a gun confronts you? When the enemy has the firepower you can't really deescalate.	"But this true in a lot of situations; I caught a burglar with a knife, and I was unarmed and unable to get at anything even remotely like a weapon. If that perp had, say, lunged at me, I would have stood a good chance -- not an ideal one -- of ending that fight (I was bigger/stronger). But if a firefight suddenly pops up -- a) usually, it's over before it began (so, no real time for police intervention), and b) then you have to be REALLY careful about discharging your weapon, as there may be innocent bystanders. And blacks DO NOT commit the disproportionate amount of crime, I simply don't buy that (I'm white, btw). There's a lot of bullshit charges screwing with statistics, of that I'm certain.

cbp3djj	If a woman argues about a wage gap, I can only think about Warren Farrell's breakdown of the 25 ways men and women choose different jobs, and see it as pure self-interest. If a black person supports reparations and affirmative action, I see it as self-interest rather than principled because they are beneficiaries. I can, however, trust a rich person who gives everything he earns to the poor, because he has every reason not to do it and is doing it anyway. Basically, the only time I take someone at face value is if they're directly acting against their own interests in some manner. **Edit:** It seems the conclusion is that every act of man is self-interested, but that self-interest several levels removed from yourself qualify as altruism. Also, conspicuous sacrifice shouldn't be used as a rubric, for the times you really want to tell them apart are the very times that sophists are incentivized to fake it.	&>>If a woman argues about a wage gap, I can only think about Warren Farrell's breakdown of the 25 ways men and women choose different jobs, and see it as pure self-interest.

cpiux04	"A few years ago, the Indian government decided that certain cities bearing colonial names should henceforth be referred to by their precolonial names --- e.g. Mumbai instead of Bombay, Kolkata instead of Calcutta, Chennai instead of Madras, etc. The reason for the change was that some nationalistic parties gained political power and decided that this would be a good way to appease their voters. This change somehow caught on not only within India, but all over the world. It is enforced so extremely in India that the censor board recently decided to ban a music video simply for using the word ""Bombay"" instead of Mumbai. My problem with this is that no government (or any authority) should have a hegemony over the English language.

Hope is what you place your faith on once you have done all you are willing to put into something you care about.

I feel that it is wrong to get songs for free when the owner is selling those songs.

My point is that the owner of the how doesn't want to sell to Latvians and that is his fundamental right.

Now, this is not to say that it's impossible to continue following your religion (regardless of whether or not it is indeed Christianity). Your next step is to realize that not all parts of your religion are to be interpreted literally. This would be ludicrous. Religious texts are most often metaphors for living a pure, worthwhile, moral life. Interpreting them as anything more than that leads to people doing crazy things like condemning homosexuality and refusing to learn about biological evolution.	Homosexuality is pretty clearly condemned as a sin, much more so then mixed fabrics in Leviticus.

cmrkcal	I have always viewed conservative as using government sparingly, conserving it and liberals using government liberally. I much prefer these terms because they accurately describe their beliefs that both sides can agree on. Edit: I could be wrong here, but conservative is usually in contrast to liberal so I assume that is talking about use of government not progress.	"It depends on the context the term is used. Alot of ""conservative"" parties such as the Republican Party are socially conservative, but economically liberal. Infact the terms mean different things in different countries. The Liberal Party of Australia is also socially conservative and economically liberal. So despite the name, it is the conservative party in the sense that Americans are used to.

If you are referring to growing plants and then burning them (this is called biofuel, right?), this is one of the least efficient methods of using sunlight energy, as even the best plants (sugar canes I think) capture only 1% of sunlight energy given to them.

They have no say in their condition, and atrocities made by them are attributed to poor care and treatment for them. They didn't chose to be insane. I think we should just send them to mental hospitals instead of killing them. This would be a more logical choice, as we can account their human rights, and care for them to their specific needs. If we are to do this instead, our society would be less fearing of them, but more accepting and wanting to outreach to them. _____ 	Define mentally ill. ADD? Autism (mild)? Hearing voices?

Individuals can get married by their church, but they should be entered into a civil union from the perspective of the government. The only argument I've heard that I can sympathize with is that this will lead to further expansion of the definition of a civil union, to eventually allow polyamorous groups to gain the rights of a civil union. I personally don't have an issue with this either, but I suppose I can understand why some people may. _____ 	"I only ever see this argument brought up when gay marriage is being debated.

cijtk99	Okay so, my problem with the reasoning with this. If the explicit intention of an action determines how it should be treated, then you're right that the Confederacy is worse than the US. But in the same, that also seems to indicate that, despite someone's interpretation of the flag, if your reasons are not racist, that it's okay for you to fly it. It is not, after all, your explicit intention to further racism by flying the flag. If the *effect* and not the intention is what decides the acceptability of an action, then yes flying the Confederate flag is wrong, but then so is flying the US flag, as even though it is not the express intention of the flagbearer to support the heinous actions of the US, the effect is that they do.	&>>But in the same, that also seems to indicate that, despite someone's interpretation of the flag, if your reasons are not racist, that it's okay for you to fly it.

cezcxgl	Fair enough. But honestly, though, the insane cost of IVF is one of the factors I balk at. I would be more agreeable to your point if it was way cheaper and also guaranteed to work. Another point I should have added in my post is overpopulation. It's somewhat disturbing to me that with a planet so overcrowded as it is, people want to have more children rather than adopt. Adoption to me is solving three problems at once - a kid gets a family, a family gets a kid, and without adding to the existing human population! Win-win! As far as morals go, however, I'm childfree and plan to stay that way, so perhaps I'm biased in that I'm far less sympathetic to this situation than if I had a burning desire to reproduce as much as possible.	Adoption is usually a lot more expensive than IVF though. I know some people that adopted a baby from China, and after travel expenses and everything, it cost them over 50k. According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the average price of an IVF cycle in the US is about $12,400. And for some people part of that is covered by insurance. Also, there are millions of reasons you can be rejected by adoption agencies, it can take several years, and you don't get to know anything about your child's genetic history and predisposition to certain diseases and mental illnesses.	0.9992630485182948	0.5032583347756457	3.0	1.0	4.0	neutral	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5017778	0.43322223	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	1	1	9	0.8888888888888888	negative	0

caiuznc	"If someone has a fear of whatever crime they're committing being done to them, I believe that they would be much less likely to commit the crime. Not only this, it is in my opinion the fairest way of dealing with things. It's hard to argue that the punishment would be unfair since they're doing to the criminal exactly what they did to somebody else. In addition, it goes a long way into promoting the ""golden rule(do unto others)"" because it allows people to view every situation from all angles and would naturally get people to live more perceptive of other peoples' suffering. Now, there would have to be exceptions for this rule due to practical reasons, but in my opinion, since the recidivism levels for criminals is so high, I don't think merely keeping them from society and letting them build up their anger and associate themselves with other angry repressed criminals necessarily is effective. I don't see ""eye for an eye"" as any less humane than that. I don't understand how people see this as inhumane, or not an effective means of justice. My view is that it is the ultimate form of justice. Change it."	"Eye for an Eye is just the golden rule inverted. ""Do unto others..."" kind of thing. Here's my objection to that: Let's say we all agreed to live by the ""eye for an eye"" standard. Now meet Ted. Ted becomes sexually stimulated when people force themselves on him, torture him, and rape him. If Ted wants it done to him, should he do it to others? The problem with ""eye for an eye"" is that it doesn't always serve justice.

Dog and pigs, cats and cows- I don't see why they are considered different insofar as we protect some from pain and suffering, but not others.

cosodyj	But we do allow the government and other powerful entities to censor people's speech. You (usually) cannot go out into your neighborhood late at night with a megaphone and make lots of noise, you cannot commit perjury in a court, reveal military troop movements, etc. These are all forms of censorship that still preserve the essential positives of free speech without allowing specific negatives of free speech. Putting limits on electioneering can be scary, because campaigning for office is such an important part of a representative democracy, but I don't doubt that there are ways to fix the problem without favoring one opinion over the other (which would be the main problem with limits related to elections). edit: removed a poorly placed word	"We censor speech exclusively when it directly violates other rights. Campaigning does not violate other rights, and therefore there isn't a legitimate reason to subject it to restriction. (Perjury and military secrets are an explicit contract with the government with the understanding of legal penalties, which is a different issue.) Furthermore, none of the cases you mentioned are related to political speech, which must remain as free as possible. The entire purpose of free speech is so that people can be free to express whatever they want about the political process. &>>I don't doubt that there are ways to fix the problem without favoring one opinion over the other I certainly do.

Changing one's view on this issue is difficult because it goes directly against the genetic directive to continue living. All genes are imprinted with instructions to not die and to procreate. For some of us that translates to a fear of death, for others it's simply a desire to live instead of die.

Even if there were an infinite regression of causes, it seems to me that this still wouldn't avoid the problem. We would still need to explain why the infinite regression existed in the first place (although ""first place"" in this sense doesn't mean in the actual chronological sense, but in more overall sense). So no matter what, it seems that there must be some first thing that is just there for no reason and with no cause. Please change my view."

cfnd3b6	"But then again, *largely* shared among *most* humans doesn't necessarily mean something is right (or wrong for that matter), right? I subscribe to the idea that morality is wholly subjective and what we ultimately term and 'right' and 'wrong' comes, in a large part, from previous experiences/mistakes. Take slavery, for example. During the time of American Independence and up until much after Lincoln's time *most* people had no moral compunctions with owning slaves. But now, in hindsight, we call that immoral and racist behaviour because we know of its merits and demerits now, *in retrospect*. Similarly, what we may term right or wrong now maybe turned on their head a thousand years in the future, and the ideas prevailing *at that time* will be used to judge if something is 'morally right' or 'morally wrong' *during that time*. What I'm trying to say, in a nutshell, is that these ""factors"" that you say morality is composed of are *also* highly subjective and their meanings evolve and change over time - and not necessarily in the direction that is, as you put it, ""*largely* shared amongst *most* humans"""	I think you misunderstand what right and wrong means. Right and wrong doesn't exist outside set standards so nothing can be just right and wrong just like things cannot be large or small if there is not something to judge it by.

You're white, so you automatically benefit from having society built upon the assumption that white makes you better than non-whites (though there is/has been a pecking order amongst whites). Same for being male -- society was built on the assumption that men are better/more important than women. You're American? Your land is stolen from natives, an economy and lifestyle secured by genocide. If European colonialists and later American troops and citizens didn't participate in the driving off/killing of an entire race then America would be drastically different. It's not really feeling guilty or even responsible for it, just understanding how others have been hurt by previous actions and how you have reaped enormous benefit from them.

cp9cpa1	My proposition is simple: Wars are fought with weapons. They are literally the fuel for all modern conflicts. A practical and effective solution would be a multilateral approach at demilitarization and weapons embargos. I say this as a general point as an emphasis on the ideological framework of waging war, not as some easy solution to the problem. I contend that serious movement behind this front will dramatically reduce armed conflict. Currently, western ideology for fighting wars is overwhelmingly centered around use of force (Syria (2015), Iraq (2003), Afghanistan (2001), Bosnia (1995) etc...). This is obviously not optimal - new ideas must be implemented that efficiently and non-destructively (as possible) reduce the threat of war. I think this can be accomplished with a massive demilitarization campaign. I will be back later to respond to queries! Change my view.	To a large degree, what you want to happen is already happening. Hundreds of armed conflicts are already prevented via economic pressure and control. The fact that the US can maintain its global dominance without constantly suppressing armed rebellions is testament to the power of economic control. Violence is almost always a last resort. If you think the smattering of massacres and minor wars we've had in the last 70~ years are bad, you don't want to see what a world without a common goal of economic prosperity looks like.	0.9502752187426792	0.9182958340544896	2.333333333333333	1.2222222222222223	3.888888888888889	neutral	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5017778	0.43322223	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	2	9	0.6666666666666666	expert	0
cfbx8nq	The frontpage of reddit simultaneously reflects two things. 1) Celebration of the legalization of marijuana 2) Denigration of cigarettes and the people that smoke them The latter category of popular posts includes those about laws that make smoking extremely difficult or prohibitively expensive. The justification is that people should be forced to stop smoking because it's bad for them. The former category of posts includes those about laws that make marijuana smoking easier. The justification is that people should be free to choose their favorite method of relaxation, and that weed is no more harmful than cigarettes or alcohol. The freedom argument isn't applied to cigarettes, and the health argument isn't applied to marijuana. THERE ARE NO CONCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT CIGARETTES ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN MARIJUANA OR VICE VERSA. Indeed, such a study would be impossible to conduct, given the breadth of factors and difference in individuals. The difference between them is an entirely illusive one, yet the groupthink believes strongly in the denigration of one and the celebration of the other.	"The relative health effects of cigarettes and marijuana have been pretty well covered in this thread, but I think there is a simpler way to demonstrate that your view is invalid. For those outside of the ""stoner"" (no deprecation intended) community, the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana is often framed as either a civil rights issue, or a small government issue. For the civil rights folks, it's about preventing unjust enforcement that allows police to unfairly target racial or socioeconomic minorities. While drug laws obviously don't *cause* poor police behavior, reforming them can help *prevent* poor police behavior. For the small government folks, it's about not wasting money. Enforcing anti-marijuana laws is damned expensive, and since people don't seem to think smoking weed is that bad, why waste taxpayer dollars on it? Since neither of these views conflict with the position that cigarettes are unhealthy, they are not delusional, and definitely not insane. In order for your view to be correct, you have to show that these positions *do* conflict with the claims about cigarettes, or that they are insane for some other (non-health) reason that you didn't outline in OP."	0.9971807518362464	0.5032583347756457	2.2222222222222223	1.1111111111111112	4.222222222222222	neutral	0.5555555555555556	7	0.5017778	0.43322223	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	6	0	3	9	0.8888888888888888	expert	0

cce2u9u	Ive seen a lot of hatred recently towards payday loan companies and I don't understand it. These companies offer fast loans to get you out of an unusual financial bind that can usually be covered by your next paycheck. Yes they offer insanely high interest rates but they're not intended to be long term loans. A lot of people seem to think they should be illegal but I don't understand why. Personally I think that if you sign up for a loan without knowing how much you'll probably need to pay then it's your own fault if you can't afford it and not that of the company that provides the service. Furthermore I think these companies offer a valuable service to certain people that for whatever reason need money fast but have no other forms of credit to use. I think the sob/hate stories that come from their practices usually come from people who misused the loan. Please feel free to enlighten me to the gate some people feel towards these companies and CMV.	"A lot of your pro-payday loan argument seems to center around a ""because fuck them!"" mentality. People are dumb enough to agree to these horribly exploitative loans, therefore...what? They cease to be exploitative?

This is because, while you were employed, you paid unemployment insurance that was a percentage of your salary. For folks who were making well above minimum wage, if unemployment pays more them more than minimum wage, than it would be unproductive of them to get a job at McDonald's.

clykyn4	Capitalism is defined by the private ownership of capital (factories, cash) used to make a profit. Profit is earned because capitalists pay less for labor of workers than they make fro the same labor. They are able to do this because for whatever reason, they own the capital (factory) and the workers don't. So that's why it's called inherently exploitative. Because for the system to even work, the workers need to be paid less than they produce. This is fundamental to capitalism and it's not an optional feature. I don't mean this to come off as a judgment of capitalism or some kind of argument for/against it. This is just how it's defined. 	"Workers are paid according to their marginal product. Profits (AKA the consumer surplus of labor) are the wedge between the marginal and average productivity of workers. This isn't exploitative. Capital contributes to productivity too, and profits are equal to the marginal product of capital. If you paid workers according to average productivity, there would be nothing left for the investors, and thus there would be no investors. I'd like to see a coherent definition of ""exploitation"" from those who say capitalism is exploitative."	0.8408189667583843	0.9182958340544896	3.2222222222222223	1.8888888888888888	3.6666666666666665	neutral	0.7777777777777778	7	0.47577778	0.3932222	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	2	4	9	0.6666666666666666	GPT	0

cfcfvc8	&>>So basically if you're feeling low enough already to start begging, then you're going to make more than if you were working minimum wage (this was without factoring in handouts of food and other supplies), which under a capitalism's model makes you more successful; so why bother working? The kickstarter study, if true, only applies for the time period and location of the researcher. If the supply of panhandlers go up, then you'd see diminishing returns coming from the donating population. If the supply of panhandlers goes up, it can also be a systemic sign that there's a shrinking population of non-homeless, meaning there also less donors. The point I'm making is that trying to make actionable policy based upon this snapshot in time (that panhandling may yield higher income than minimum wage) would be foolish.	Obviously there are a huge number of variables and there was no way a single guy could make it statistically acceptable.

ceay1c6	How would externalities affect the price of labor? If the externalities were included in the price of the product there would be less sales. Would that also lower wages for workers of the companies that sell that product? What is beneficial to society is increases in GDP and per capita GDP. How would you measure most good other than GDP?	"Accounting for externalities would absolutely affect the price of labor. For example, if a government instituted subsidies for education, demand for education would increase. And if demand for education increases, the market value of teachers would probably increase, therefore teachers would be paid more. And since education has positive externalities (for example, having better medical education benefits more than just doctors), society is now better off despite the fact that teachers are getting paid a greater amount than their natural market value. And this can go both ways, a tax on coal would bring down demand for coal, and thus reduce the income of the owners of coal mines. And I would say most good would be difficult to measure, but I would say (and I think most people would agree) that the ideal measure of ""societal good"" would be the improvements in the lives of others.

cgtsos8	Organic food sales and autism increased at almost the exact same rate between 1997 and 2009. I don't see people out there protesting in the streets against organic food. Autism is actually a good example since many things are correlated with its increase yet people (as in, anti vaxxers) cherry pick which correlations suit their cause. I know this thread isn't about that but it's a good example of why it is not just wrong to imply that correlation equals causation; it can actually be dangerous.	I think there's something to be said here. One can develop a model for how vaccines cause autism. It is true that we have very good data showing that vaccines do not cause autism, but when this data was not available - it isn't as clear to me how people should have reacted. I would claim that it would have been prudent for drug companies to devote resources to probe a link. And that did happen. On the other hand - I think it is harder to develop a model for why organic food would cause a spike in autism. I do agree however - that it can be dangerous. And as your claims get larger and larger in scope and advocating more serious action - it is imperative that your claims are more critically addressed. There is an active harm associated with shunning vaccines for example. But if such a harm does not exist.

"	We infer there is a duty not to steal because doing so is taking something that you are not in rightful ownership of. A person has rightful ownership of the money supposedly because either it was transferred to them by someone else (e.g., like if your uncle gave you his inheritance when he died, even though he didn't have to) or because it is the fruits of their labor (e.g., you worked for it). I'm not sure how one could argue we have the right to ensure the survival of our fellow man. Surely it would be morally praiseworthy to do so, but it doesn't seem we have a duty to do so.

With that said, is there no good thing religion does that cannot be achieved by purely secular means. Trough history, religion has been the source of unjustified tortures, killings and wars. The spreading of hatred and bigotry. They have, and still deny scientific evidence to dupe its followers into a belief system based solely on the belief in things without evidence. If there was no religion we'd be a far smarter and intelligent society as a whole, as well as a lower-crime rate and more advanced technology and inventions.

cjwqy9o	This is the first new information I've read on this thread. Below, someone referenced a source that stated agriculture used 80-85% of developed water in California. You're saying that's now down to 40%. I'd be curious to read about that change. What period of time are we talking about here? Urban use grows as population increases, which it seems always to do in this state. And urban water use is a lot more than watering lawns, which I agree can be wasteful. (Though it's not completely unreasonable for people to want to have an area, say, for their kids to play. It's okay for humans to use some resources to enjoy life.) And how does industry fit into this? If agriculture uses only 40% and urban use is 10%, where's the other 50% going?	The 80% figure pulls from an economist article in 2009, though on further reading it sounded a bit suspect- and I found a counterpoint [Here](http://californiawaterblog.com/2011/05/05/water%E2%80%94who-uses-how-much/). The question boils down to what is considered Agricultural and Environmental water. The 80 to 40% change was due to more sustainable practices and wetland reclamation. With a countering view factored in, the drop of water consumption by agriculture would be only 20%, instead of 40% (I need to learn to vet my sources better). So the three main uses of water in the state are Environmental (Water that we let flow through natural ecosystems), Agricultural, and Urban. Environmental and Urban expenditure have increased over the last 30 years, while Agricultural, as far as I can find, has decreased slightly. 	0.9960146490748468	0.0	2.2222222222222223	1.4444444444444444	4.333333333333333	positive	0.7777777777777778	7	0.47577778	0.3932222	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	5	9	1.0	expert	0

cj6s8x2	Because it isn't just about tolerating those who are different from you. It's about not interfering with people's civil liberties. Not all difference is good. The Unabomber was different, but I can't say that the world would be better if he was still doing what he's famous for. The reason to not tolerate those who oppose the legalization of gay marriage is because if they go unopposed, people are denied their civil rights and liberties. The reason to not tolerate the institutional oppression of women in certain countries (and indeed in the west too) is because to fail to do so would be implicitly saying that it's okay to oppress women. The reason to refuse to associate with racists is because, well, you get the point. I think that you'll find that my explanation here isn't dissimilar to the explanation given by /u/jetpacksforall. I would argue that, contrary to your response to him, the view of intolerance that he espouses is *quite* mainstream (as evidenced, perhaps, by the fact that it's the top response in this thread). You should probably award him/her a delta.	 I asked the question to another poster, and I will ask it to you. If a person feels gay marriage is a bad environment for a child, even believing it will cause the child emotional abuse, and a gay couple in their community wants to adopt, should they get involved, because of the poor innocent child? Alternatively, if a middle eastern couple in your community has a different view of gender roles, one they accept but you define as oppressive or even emotionally abusive, should the community get involved?

cbhzo7j	First, some clarification: I am, of course, not supporting child molestation or anything of that nature. I do believe, however, that being attracted to pre-pubescent children is a sexual orientation that was not in the control of the pedophile himself/herself. Just as homosexuality is not a choice, I do not believe pedophilia is, either. I think that pedophiles that do not act upon their urges are not inherently immoral simply for feeling sexual desires that they can not help. If they do not act upon their urges, they are not harming anybody. If anything, the fact that they are burdened with having sexual desires that will never be fulfilled should make people sympathize with them, not hate/feel disgust towards them. Again, just to avoid people misinterpreting what I am saying: I do NOT condone child molestation, child pornography, or other activities that can harm children. CMV.

cmwvsmh	You see that's actually a dynamic I find kind of interesting and sort of get sad when I see it brought up. There always seems to be a huge stigma (which does occur sometimes even on /r/cfb) about Walmart fans. I would like to believe that fan bases should ALWAYS be open and welcoming to someone who has made the decision to support and be a part of something no matter their ability to contribute with time or money, so long as the emotional tie is there. But to me I almost enjoy the specified nature of CFB fan bases. Lets look at the Patriots, they have pretty much all of NE. How much is someone who lives in Boston going to have in common with a guy from the back country of Maine. With college I can generally assume that the fellow fan either personally or had a close relative spend 3,4,5...8 years in the same place I did having a relatable experience.	Exclusivity is a bit part of the appeal of college, frats, nightclubs etc. They are fun for the people who get in, but they leave lots of people at the door. So while you might think that college football is a better experience for you personally, it is the worse experience for the vast majority of people in the US. Also, even though college football communities are very accepting of people who want to support their team, what appeal is there for someone to start if they don't have a connection? Evangelical Christians are very supportive of people who want to check out their church, but what is the appeal for Muslims, Jews, atheists, etc. to do so in the first place? The big appeal of the NFL is that it's like Coke. It doesn't matter if you are a broke janitor or the president of the United States. Coke tastes like Coke no matter who you are. Watching pro football is a way to connect with people regardless of race, social class, educational status, etc. rather than a way to reinforce differences.	0.0392863765560357	0.9910760598382222	3.555555555555556	1.2222222222222223	3.0	neutral	0.7777777777777778	9	0.47577778	0.3932222	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	3	1	5	9	0.5555555555555556	GPT	0

cekfn5d	There are many, many things that should be different about the US health care system, but I'm deliberately keeping this narrow, so don't strain yourself to argue broader questions unless you really want to. Nurse Practitioners are highly experienced and highly trained, even though they don't have the same training as a doctor. Nonetheless, they have at least enough experience to learn, in tailored courses (perhaps geared around night classes) the full med school curriculum in a compressed timeframe and to have an abbreviated residency/internship phase. Letting long-time health care workers get medical degrees with less time and debt, but the same standards, as it would take them otherwise would increase the number of qualified doctors and increase the allure of nursing, since the ceiling on career advancement is lifted.	"Perhaps a 2nd classification between doctor and nurse would be in order. After all, most docs go through a lot more training than they need in a narrow field of practice.

I'm no expert on Israeli nationality law but apparently all non-Jewish residents of Palestine before the 1948 Arab-Israeli War who remained in the country were granted Israeli citizenship.

cmxhi2k	In the main series of Pokémon games, Pokémon can learn certain moves that allow the trainer to perform special actions outside of battle. These include surf, which allows you to travel on water, and fly, which allows you quickly travel between areas. The problem with these is that Pokémon can only learn 4 moves at a time. Most of these moves cannot be replaced easily like others can. This means that players either have to sacrifice one of these moves or carry around a Pokémon specifically for these moves. This is an unnecessary barrier. The only reason these field moves were introduced is to structure progress throughout the Pokémon region and the only reason they remain is tradition. Items could just as easily serve the same function, as they do in several fan games such as /r/pokemonzetaomicron. In ORAS, the move fly already has a replacement that solves this issue.	"Whilst it could seem like bad design to limit the player in this way, a sort of handicap is applied to the late game. In requiring at least one Pokemon in your party to use each move, you either need one Pokemon specifically for the purpose of using HMs, or spread it out. This adds a sense of ""What do I need to build the strongest?"", thereby promoting strong thinking and choosing what to handicap.

coka2q4	Long story short, my girlfriend's parents, in my opinion, are deadbeats.

cifizo6	I've seen this argument quite frequently but the thing is if there is a profitable investment opportunity the investor will still make the investment regardless of what the marginal tax rate on his profits will be. In either event the investment gets made because profits is realized. Albeit, in one example it is marginally lower.	If this were true then pretty much every profitable investment opportunity would always be taken, which in turn would mean that real interest rates would be at pretty much zero pretty much all the time. That's the case right now because of the recession but in general it isn't. So we can conclude that there is some level of profitability below which the marginal investor will choose to spend their money immediately rather than invest it. Thus a higher rate of capital gains tax will discourage investment.	0.9543797283100351	0.5916727785823275	3.7142857142857135	1.5714285714285714	4.142857142857143	neutral	0.7142857142857143	5	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	4	1	2	7	0.8571428571428571	negative	0
cmckczb	I love John Mulaney and his stand up and was very excited fir his sitcom to come out. When it premiered I was very disappointed because I hated the pilot. It felt like there was a forced integration of his stand up into the plot of the show, but after watching a few more episodes the show has grown on me. They've moved from forcing the stand up into the plot to using the stand up to set up the plot. Episodes 2-5 had me laughing so hard and I don't understand why the show is still getting bad reviews. I believe people watched the pilot and formed an opinion and then closed their mind to the rest of the season.	I guess i'm the only one here who had the opposite experience. I liked the pilot, and when i tuned in to whatch following episodes, i was very disappointed. Not that the pilot was great, but it showed potential.

c98uuju	Because of Reddit's upvote/downvote system, the ideas that most people agree with float to the top while those that people don't agree with are down-voted and ignored. The result is that what most people see is the popular consensus. Obviously there are some exceptions (such as this subreddit) and that's not the way it's supposed to work (since you're not supposed to downvote things just because you disagree with them). But it seems to me like there is just a lot of back-scratching and reinforcing of opinions. Note: I'm not advocating we get rid of the up vote system. I actually really like it. But after stalking the community for a good while, and judging by the things that make the front page, I'm convinced that this is a good place for confirmation bias unless you're actively seeking a challenge to your views. Am I wrong?	It really depends on the subreddit and the size of a subreddit. In small and medium reddits you can have exchanges that don't get lost in the mass of comments and you recognise posters (who aren't reddit celebrities), basically your post appeals to individuals instead of a mass of people so you spend less time second guessing what people want to hear and actually post what you think/a relevant comment. I do agree with you regarding the larger subreddits but that is true of most of the internet and the direction is headed. The internet is becoming more and more tailored to specific demographics (instead of broad demographics), your facebook feed is designed to show posts from people with the same interests as you, adverts are targeted at you and the news you read probably has similar opinions in its opinion pages. Having the web become much more individualised is a double edge sword where we cut ourselves off from different views and experiences and absorb only what feels right or results in confirmation bias. 	0.7614454132229361	0.863120568566631	3.571428571428572	1.2857142857142858	4.285714285714286	neutral	0.7142857142857143	6	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	1	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0
ccz7tyf	"To avoid confusion I'd like to define the term existential nihilism as the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or purpose, and nothing that anybody does (or that the human race does as a whole) will matter at all in the long run. Note that, based on this definition, changing my view on only one of the two qualifiers would change my opinion on the matter, as existential nihilism requires both to be true. At the same time, though, when I say ""nothing will matter at all in the long run"" I'm not talking about the differences that humanity will cause in terms of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or something of similar vein. I mean that humanity will never accomplish a worthwhile goal, one that will result in life having reached its predetermined objective or have truly 'succeeded' in any way.

I just think it distracts from learning and more time should be spent in making sure each student learns at their own pace.

cbjjlqf	I'm simply wondering if polygamous people need to seek a legal marriage with the accompanying benefits in order to exercise their religious beliefs in plural marriage. A religious marriage doesn't need to come with rights to a spouse's social security benefits or health insurance in order for it to count in the eyes of a particular religion. I don't think the state should prosecute people practicing polygamous relationships, but I also don't see why persons in a polygamous relationship need the state's recognition of the plural marriage. Asking for the government to endorse and accomodate every religion's particular beliefs is not what freedom of religion is about. 	&>> but I also don't see why persons in a polygamous relationship need the state's recognition of the plural marriage.Asking for the government to endorse and accomodate every religion's particular beliefs is not what freedom of religion is about.

The problem came along when Christians began to think their religion is the only religion and all the others are just heathenish.

As long as there's free competition, they will. A lot of the businesses you describe (colleges and banks in particular) depend on government support to be able to act as badly as they do. So the problem isn't as much the colleges or banks themselves, it's the government programs (including non-dischargability of student loans in bankruptcy). When there's competition among businesses, the good weed out the bad quickly. People remember that they overbought and it took an hour to shop at Wal-Mart, and then they decide not to go back. But that only works if there's another store competing. If you can get the government to come in and squash out your competition such as how cable companies get statutory monopolies, then you can be exploitative, since your customers can't exit.	0.1069129425947421	0.9852281360342516	3.0	1.0	3.571428571428572	neutral	0.7142857142857143	5	0.32900003	0.40500003	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	0	2	7	0.4285714285714285	expert	0

However, that is not due to the demerits of the argument, but due to the severity of the accusation.

cdtksvz	I believe that telling a woman she can use one organ (her brain) to make money, but not another organ (her vagina) is anti-american. I think saying that it is illegal to do something for money which is perfectly legal to do for free is also illogical. I think that all of the negatives that come out of prostitutions such as the risk of disease, murder, drug addiction all come from the illegality of it more than the prostitution itself. I think there are many very dangerous jobs, like crab fisherman, stunt men, fire fighters, which are legal. I think Prostitution should be legal, Change My View.	For the record, men can be prostitutes as well. Also, besides being dangerous phsyically, sex is a very personal thing for a lot of people. Someone selling their body sexually for money could be very desperate for that money, and the experience could leave them mentally scarred even if physical scars aren't present. You may also want to take into account that fishermen, stuntmen, and firefighters don't actively spread their injures, pains, and deaths to other people. A prostitute can both receive and spread STIs, and legalizing prostitution could spread STIs at an increased rate. Legalizing prostitution could be somewhat beneficial economically, but it presents dangers to those who participate whether they be employees or clients, and those dangers can be spread to people who have no association with the business of prostitution.

I was pointing out that you could emotionally not support yourself being punished but rationally think that you and others should be punished and thereby support punishment of others and not yourself.	0.9934637206486208	0.0	3.0	1.5714285714285714	3.2857142857142856	neutral	0.7142857142857143	6	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	4	1	2	7	1.0	expert	0

And since you claim to enjoy 1v1 Starcraft, I can reasonably assume that you enjoy the concept of competition on some level. This is really what MOBAs boil down to: they are inherently competitive games. For me at least (I play LoL), that's a lot of the appeal of it. Playing ranked games to see how good I really am, both at playing the game and learning to be better. I don't need my friends in order to do that, since that's what solo queue is for. I do have many friends that play the game, but I don't need them in order to enjoy that aspect of the game. In fact, when I do play with my friends, it's usually with a completely different mindset than when I play by myself. Now, extend this to yourself. What do you enjoy about playing video games? Do you enjoy competitive games in general, or is Starcraft an exception? If you enjoy the competition, MOBAs really capture the spirit of competition very well.

cc5q8cu	"I'm a teenager living in Britain and there is one thing that has irked me for as long as I remember forming my own views on things; I hate overseas charity. Despite being a first world country, as of 2008, 23% of Britain's population was in poverty. 13.5 million people. It's also claimed that 60% of those in poverty are actually house-owners. Issues such as domestic abuse are still staggeringly high, with the most-at-risk age for such abuse rapidly falling, currently lying within secondary school age. With so many potentially hungry and underprivileged people on our own land, why are we sending money elsewhere? This to me seems like trying to push your friend in a wheelchair whilst you're on crutches yourself. I'm quite fond of the ""Look after your own"" mentality, as I'm quite rational and blunt when it comes to survival and human life. Huge amounts of cash (as well as material goods) are sent to help those in need, all around the world. Yet government is cutting funding to local charities and support services. This makes no sense to me, and strikes me as flawed logic of the highest order. Change my view?"	Poverty in the UK is not the same as poverty in developing countries. The official poverty line in the UK is 60% of the median household income, which at present is about £120/week for a single adult with no children. The international poverty line is $1.25/day, which comes to about £290/year. So someone just at the poverty line in Britain makes about as much in 3 weeks as someone on the international poverty line does in a year. Basically, the poorest people in the UK are generally much better off than the poorest people worldwide, so it's perfectly reasonable that we spend some money on addressing international poverty before we have completely eradicated poverty in this country. It's worth noting that going by the British poverty measure, if everyone suddenly earned 10 times as much as they did today and there was no inflation, the poverty level would stay the same. Poverty is defined here compared to other people in the country, not based on being able to afford basic goods, as you might expect.	0.989649906633842	0.5916727785823275	2.857142857142857	1.0	4.285714285714286	neutral	0.7142857142857143	6	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	7	0	0	7	0.8571428571428571	negative	0

caeno8z	Background: The supreme court case Richardson v Ramirez upheld the ruling stating that disenfranchisement of felons is constitutional. Currently, around 5.3 millions Americans have been disenfranchised for being convicted felons, which factors in both people still serving time and who have finished their sentence. Prison populations are also not representative of the population at large, nor are all convicted felons violent criminals (for instance, minorities are more likely to be classified as felons for a similar crimes). In addition, allowing felons/ex-felons to vote would not cause landslide victories. Even if you were morally against letting a convicted murderer vote, it would likely not be a make or break an election. It's important to stick up for civil rights for all citizens, because when you start to draw lines you create inequality. 	"I think you are right, but your reasons are wrong.

In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated. Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives and some people do and the same thing happens. I would assume this is because of our biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick and people who aren't vaccinated get sick. My conclusion is why should people be forced to vaccinate kids if they don't want to. They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision and people should be satisfied with that.

cag7fjn	Words like fuck, shit, dick, cunt, bitch, whore, dick, ass, and the like should not be viewed as offensive. I believe that saying a single words should not be considered as bad as doing the act itself. It's more appropriate to say sex than fuck, butt than ass, feces than shit, and jerk than douche. This makes no sense to me. I just can't see the reason that these words are offensive.	"Penn and Teller named their show ""Bullshit"" and then, in some episode, explained that their hero Houdini did something similar when he went out to debunk psychics, he used the word ""Humbug"". (I think the show where they explained this was the one about profanity itself). ""Humbug"" seems tame now, but back then it carried the same weight and offensive potential that ""bullshit"" means now. It just got used into tameness. Damn. Social groups tend to create, or demean certain words to the status of vulgarity because it serves a purpose. They are usually connected with whatever is taboo in that culture, so cultures comfortable with nudity or female toplessness are rarely scandalized by ""tits"", ""boobs"", ""knockers"", etc. Some concepts will always stay offensive because of human normals that don't change from culture to culture. There will always be a verboten word for feces, but ""ass"" has been losing its impact lately, mostly because of subtle cultural shifts."	0.9938085955529088	0.0	2.857142857142857	1.1428571428571428	3.571428571428572	neutral	0.7142857142857143	4	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	1	7	1.0	GPT	0
ci35bpa	Take a situation where an individual is drunk at a party. Another notices him or her and requests to have a sexual encounter. If the first individual consents, then the individual has waived his or her right to accuse rape. This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the firsts drink or, in any way, use the situation to his or her advantage maliciously (e.g. getting him or her drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse) This was spurred by a discussion between me and my girlfriend the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, my own being the one presented.	This has been discussed a million times on here, so a search will probably help a lot. &>> If the first individual consents, then the individual has waived his or her right to accuse rape. Consent can be withdrawn at any time during an encounter, and everything should then stop immediately. it is not right to say that if you consent at first you are implicitly okay with everything that happens from that moment on. Secondly - if a person is drunk enough that they might not be using their full judgement, or that they might do something and regret it later, then why would you even *want* to have sex with them? Enthusiastic consent makes for a much better mutual experience than 'God I hope [x] doesn't remember this in the morning'.	0.9938085955529088	0.0	2.7142857142857144	1.4285714285714286	3.2857142857142856	neutral	0.7142857142857143	5	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	2	0	7	1.0	expert	0

cq1fjtj	"This might not be directly changing your view but I consider it relevant nontheless: I recently finished ready the [baghavad gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita), one of the core scriptures of Hinduism (the translation and commentary by Eknath Easwaran is highly recommended). Having watched the BBC documentary ""Jesus was a Buddhist monk"" I found the idea of Jesus bringing far-eastern philosophy/religion to the middle east a tad bit far fetched, but after the gita not anymore. In some chapters it seemed you only needed to exchange ""Krishna"" for ""God/Jahve"" and you'd get the essence of Jesus teachings about giving yourself to god and salvation through love."	While I don't think Jesus had any direct encounters with Buddhism or Hinduism, I do feel that there is an aspect of eastern philosophy present in his teachings. Alan Watts actually has a good lecture on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42V8BGBvTk &>> “Jesus Christ knew he was God. So wake up and find out eventually who you really are. In our culture, of course, they’ll say you’re crazy and you’re blasphemous, and they’ll either put you in jail or in a nut house (which is pretty much the same thing).

caiqqxg	"A lot of people I know are not organ donors because of reasons like ""I want to keep my body when I'm dead"" or other, rather honestly, tenuous reasons. I believe if you actively choose not to be an organ donor, you should be considered last for transplants if you need one. Why should someone else's sacrifice go to someone who wouldn't be willing to do the same? Note I said by choice. I'm under the impression that if people won't donate because of religion (although I disagree with this, but this is besides my point at this time), that they would not receive organs for transplantation as well. In addition, people who are not legally capable of making this choice are not subjected to the title (children, for instance). Now I'm not trying to generalize my experiences I've had with people who would not register as an organ donor, but I feel like it will still provide an interesting discussion otherwise."	I thought about this and didn't really think that method was fair. I mean you don't really get a chance to think empathetically when you're happy and well. It should either be opt out, and everyone is automatically entered at birth, or whatever age transplanting becomes viable. You can then opt out, by parents will or your own. That would solve the transplant donor shortfalls in one generation. If you really wanted to be a jerk about the whole thing, though. What you could say is that anyone who has a (major) surgical procedure is put on the donor list with no way to be removed. The argument being that you have benefited from the system, and the payment should be all your healthy bits after you die.

cp6aiw5	So the essential premise of my thoughts on the subject are that if you want to live overall, and will still want to live if you lose something, it's not worth dying to save it. The example that immediately comes to mind is military service. If life is really worth living to you it makes no sense to sacrifice it for anything you can live without. Just to clarify, appeals to altruism/morality are irrelevant to my question. I want to know if you guys can come up with a reason a self-interested person would want to sacrifice him/her/non-gender-specific-pronounself. _____ 	Oh that's easy. If the crazy context arose which there was no other option but for me to die so my daughter could live, I'd die in a heartbeat. And it's because of self-interest. Life wouldn't be worth living if I made the other choice. How could I live with myself? The shame and guilt would destroy me anyway! She'd worth dying for, but I wouldn't consider it a sacrifice, because I'm trading something of no value to me (her death and my future debilitating shame) for something of great value to me (her life and my last few seconds of pride).	0.1079650080129422	0.9852281360342516	4.0	1.2857142857142858	3.142857142857143	positive	0.7142857142857143	6	0.32900003	0.40500003	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	1	7	0.5714285714285714	expert	0

ceh8rxr	To be clear, I am only talking about the computer aspect of Apple. For example, the Macbook and iMac lines. I could compare spec sheets, but you can do research on your own. I feel that the innovations of the mouse and the UI were amazing, but after they were matched, they didn't have that much to offer. You can get a PC with the same specs as a Mac for half the price. Their software is interesting, but not game-changing. I feel that they have peaked, and are in a decline with the computer market. They have good products, but not good enough to constitute their respective price tags. CMV.	"Regarding innovation, I would argue that there is no PC manufacturer that is more innovative than Apple. The iMac is the most successful all-in-one PC ever built. The new Mac Pro is arguably the first major innovation in the PC market since, well, the modern iMac. If Apple is not innovative, what other PC manufacturer is? The personal computing market has been in decline for the past decade. There simply isn't a tremendous amount of innovation left in the general-purpose ""PC"" form factor, with an owner-serviceable case and interchangeable components. Look no further than the problems Dell has had over the past few years to understand the decline in the traditional PC market. Regarding the price, Apple is a premium brand. It's similar to the relationship between the Lexus and Toyota brands -- or Audi/Volkswagen, Infiniti/Nissan, etc. A Lexus won't necessarily outperform a comparably-priced Toyota, but luxuries such as leather seats and wood accents are part of the base-model Lexus. Similar to Lexus cars, even the most inexpensive Apple products have impeccable ""fit and finish"".

What about the times when drafting was legal, wondering if you were going to get drafted into a war you knew you had no training for. Imagine if you were drafted as a 16 year old, the horror. What about way earlier than the 20th century. Think about how hard life would of been as a villager where being raided is a real possibility. Attack, killed, raped. In regards to people's regular lives. People's regular lives consisted of tough manual labour, unless you were of the elite, working many hours of the day in order to eat the bare minimum.

If you could link to some specific evidence that feminists think this way, I'd appreciate it. "	&>> I'm a feminist who believes very strongly that male rape is a serious and horrifying issue that needs far more exposure and all feminists in my circle agree with me That's all well and good, but the feminists who actually lobby and influence policy deeply disagree with you. So by that criteria, it is you who isn't a true feminist. If you call yourself a feminist, perhaps you should stand up to those who make your group look like sexists? Mary Koss comes to mind and has greatly influenced feminist academia. Her feminist ideology is why we have '1 in 4' inflated statistics, and she explicitly states in her book (look it up if you don't believe me) that the rape of men is a nonissue and doesn't deserve attention. Many feminists continue to take cues from her, and that is why the CDC was pressured into separating male 'rape' into a distinctly 'non-rape' category.	0.960770009823987	0.5916727785823275	3.0	1.4285714285714286	3.4285714285714284	neutral	0.7142857142857143	6	0.32900003	0.40500003	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	3	2	2	7	0.8571428571428571	expert	0

cpetjxy	The 'stoner' lifestyle is depicted as laggardly and sedentary in the media. This translates to more people associating with and labeling themselves as a stoner. When people call themselves a stoner and assume the lifestyle, relative to my thought process they are basically wasting their lives and become a burden on friends, family (parents primarily if they are younger) I think it was Southpark that said that pot isn't really dangerous medically but when you smoke it makes you alright with being bored. Going on further to see that when you're bored you should be learning new skills and bettering yourself instead of masking the boredom in smoke.

ccrajnn	Nope. Women and Men have fundamentally different biologies. For example, women are more tuned into all sorts of social cues, and are especially good at parenting and child-bearing. They also find these activities more rewarding. For example: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-08-family-linked-stress-moms-dads.html That's why they've been fulfilling those roles since the dawn of humanity. Men also have a distinct biology which accounts for a lot of the male behavior we see in the world today. Basically, I'm suggesting that genetics play a huge role in shaping male/female roles. Genetics aren't the only factor, but it's an important factor nonetheless. To ignore this is ridiculous. We can't just pretend that guys like to be stay-at-home Dad's. It's against our biology to a large extent. I don't think it's a burden to be either a male or female, at least in Western culture (Canada, USA, Europe, etc.). If we're talking about Saudi Arabia or some similar country, then I would take Rawls's equality because I don't want to live in a cloth bag my whole life. 	I disagree with this opinion. I feel you're giving far too much weight to biology in this debate. What about the way our society influences us? Culture, religion, politics - you truly think these things don't change people? Humans have built incredibly complex systems through communication and the exchange of ideas. Economic systems, political systems, social systems, you name it - they permeate our existence. We've created those systems and we influence them, but they operate largely outside the control of any one person because they follow the same laws of evolution that biological systems do. It is simply the nature of our universe. It stands to reason that gender roles aren't simply the product of biological evolution, but ideological evolution. Gender is a human construct - a social system - with a history shaped more by human interaction than the interaction of our genes or chemistry. It should be analyzed in sociological terms. In contrast, sex is biological, related to our physiology - it should be analyzed in biological terms. It's important to understand this distinction when bringing biology to the forefront of a debate around a sociological construct, because you're missing a lot of information.	0.886275398183171	0.9182958340544896	3.2222222222222223	1.8888888888888888	4.111111111111111	neutral	0.7777777777777778	6	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	6	1	2	9	0.6666666666666666	GPT	0

As long as there is no gratuitous suffering, does it really matter? The problem is in many cases there are gratuitous suffering. According to this [site](http://deathpenalthy.info.org/executions-year) 39 people were executed last year, and based off of the botched execution link above, 3 were botched. That's 8% of executions, a number that, in my opinion, isn't exactly great. That doesn't take into account that when it is botched the pain they feel is immense. 	That's cheating a bit with your statistics. If you'd picked 2013, 2012 or 2011, you'd have zero percent, since there were no botched executions. Also, in the first case, it wasn't botched - they just didn't like the procedure that was following. The second one was a shitstorm, no doubt. In the third, there's no proof that the inmate was aware of any pain, it could have just been their body reacting. In any case, I should have been clearer in how I meant gratuitous - not without pain, but not without more pain than is needed. By your rules, we need to assume that the death penalty is humane. Granted that, why does it need to be completely painless? We're already granting that murder can be humane, but somehow only painless murder is ok?

It now looks like Anthony Weiner's political career is about to receive a final nail in the coffin with the latest scandal coming out about him sending pictures to that young woman. And it's a damn shame because he was a very talented politician with courage and conviction to stand up for what he believed in. [Here he is defending healthcare compensation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O_GRkMZJn4) for firefighters in 9/11 after the measure was block on some procedural technicality. For Eliot Spitzer on the other hand, although I really liked him, it was probably the right thing for him to step down. My problem wasn't so much with him having sex with a woman, but the fact that he broke the law to do it (prostitution). I'm all for making prostitution legal, but until it is political leaders have a responsibility to uphold the law. My point goes for both republicans and democrats alike. 	1st of all - a lack of willpower means you can ultimately be corrupted fairly easily. Especially when you're paying for companionship illegally - you've got low will power, are willing to disregard the law, and in some cases (like Spitzer/Gingrich) are a hypocrite. 2nd of all - I'm holding out for more single politicians, politicians in open marriages, dating politicians, gay politicians, or whatever brings our leaders closer in line publically with who they are as people. Statistically, no way *all* our presidents should have been married &amp; never divorced. Thats just dishonest. People who don't want to be married shouldn't be. People shouldn't feel divorce/single life should impact their professional aspirations. 3rd of all - its unprofessional. Interns &amp; aides &amp; coworkers should not be romanced by their supervisors. So if the Clintons divorced or were 'open' &amp; Bill was out dating, I wouldn't care. But fucking interns?

cavnvhm	Why does insurance change things? They paid for the insurance.	"Insurance typically covers things you can't cover yourself. Health insurance for the average individual is $183/month according to eHealth. For a family of 4, that number is more like $414/month. The typical hover round costs anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000. At minimum, it would take someone a full year to come up with the money to buy the lowest end electric wheel chair and during that time they would have no health coverage for their obesity, medicine, etc. The argument is that they are paying for insurance but they're using more money than they're putting into the system. Whether or not they could ""avoid those expenses"" by getting in shape is a whole different matter. Edit: This is not my view. I was explaining why insurance changes things.

cje9ysk	Landlord here. Do not agree. I just had a 3br unit in Lakeview, Chicago, IL going for $1750. I have a buddy that is a broker and I let him have a go at renting the apartment for me... he got it rented for $2400.. a year on year increase of 25% including the fee I paid. Brokers are absolutely the better way to go. I had to do no work and got fantastically qualified tenants. Also, I do not care how it potentially effects you as a renter. I want people with money to live there. If it will financially ruin you to pay the fee I don't want you as a tenant. May sound harsh but this is a business not a charity.

ci2vkn9	This isn't referring to depression because of a terminal illness, but specifically about clinical depression prompting suicidal urges for years. Decades even. I don't view suicide as a choice - it's a fight or flight response. Some people cope others don't. Also my philosophy on the value of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated but at a certain point it becomes so chronic that pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family they are literally tortured into accepting life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully. 	There's an old cliche: suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Depression can be cured through therapy and medication that is improving all the time. If we can cure all depression and do away with sucidal thoughts, that would be preferable to suicide. The idea is that depression is a sickness that must be cured, not given into. It is an interesting contrast to terminal illness. You are talking about killing yourself over a curable illness.	0.9975762858577222	0.5032583347756457	3.0	1.1111111111111112	4.222222222222222	positive	0.7777777777777778	7	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	2	1	9	0.8888888888888888	GPT	0

These two videos have been pretty convincing and I'm going to be doing a paper on this. However, it's almost impossible to find a balanced argument. Whether this is because there are rarely any negatives to the gold standard, I'm not sure, but I would love to hear some points for and against the gold standard. Right now I'm supporting the concept.	"You can't find a balanced argument for the same reason that you can't find a balanced argument on intelligent design vs. evolution. It's just not a serious debate; there's a massive consensus that the gold standard is bad, and that fiat currency is ideal for a modern society. ""Stopping the lending cycle"" and ""creating an actual value for your money"" aren't *good* things.

Naturally we are either one or the other are we not ?

One is that a transgender person, say a mtf can possibly and it happens where a straight male is deceived into having sex with said 'trans' person thinking they are female and that is very deceiving, cus they assume the person is naturally female. Another reason is because it creates confusion in an area, where there previously wasn't and doesn't need to be. People shouldn't have to second guess if some is a male or female because all of our fundamental interactions with others differ based on whether we are communicating with a man or woman."

That's what I mean - lots of signals used to go into blink mode late at night, etc. There are still some malfunctions to the programming box that will cause a light to go into blink mode until someone comes along to fix that box. Or on more modern systems I suppose they could reset it via computer. I saw one today that was on blink mode. Occasionally a storm will cause a brief 5-10 second outage and as the lights come back on they are in blink mode until they fully start up.

Frankly, I feel like making an attempt to adopt, in and of itself, shows that the family has thought about this.

cesk3f1	I think the Seahawks have an unfair advantage because of how noisy there stadium is, and while I don't blame the Seahawks at all for building a stadium designed to create as much noise as possible, I do think the league should ban teams from doing that. If you look at the Seahawks home record versus their road record or talk to any player who has ever played there, clearly the noise is a huge advantage. If the league doesn't implement a decibel limit on stadiums (or some other way of limiting noise) you're either going to end up with every stadium being that loud or only some will and those teams will have a clear, undeniable competitive advantage. I will admit my bias right now that I'm a Niners fan, but I would still believe this even if the Niners built their new stadium to be as noisy as possible.	"I will admit my bias as well, I am a Seahawks fan. So screw you, you really cannot blame your loss on Sunday on the stadium or whatever else. But seriously, the ""engineered to maximize noise"" part is absolute crap. The stadium is loud because Seahawks fans are loud, and how are you really going to limit that? Would you stop a game if the crowd gets too loud and ask them to keep it down? Also, there is basically no proven link between the noise generated by a stadium and its teams wins. Home advantage is a given in basically every sport. There are familiar facilities, a positive crowd, and most importantly familiar ground conditions. The last part undoubtedly benefits the Seahawks the most, since they train in and are used to playing in overcast and rainy weather, which most other teams are largely unfamiliar with. This is why the Seahawks usually get a bigger edge playing at home in Seattle."	0.5428983624666911	0.9910760598382222	3.7777777777777777	2.7777777777777777	3.4444444444444446	negative	0.7777777777777778	5	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	8	1	0	9	0.5555555555555556	GPT	0

Those three arguments are probably very similar to what I'd end up saying if I formulated a full argument--if you don't have any response (at all?) to them, then I don't know what else there is to add? I guess I would say that gay pride probably only reinforces hate or prejudice in people who were already hateful or prejudiced. I highly doubt that there has been anyone on the fence about the issue who decided that, because of pride parades, they should hate gay people or whatever. (In fact, I imagine the only people whose biases could be influenced in any meaningful way by pride parades are those who are too set in their beliefs to listen to any evidence or reasoning anyway)	"I think it's completely unreasonable to expect everyone to always find flaws in arguments or accept them. It's really important to be able to play with and think about arguments for awhile. Especially with complicated issues that have a lot of sides to them. But I do have some arguments against them (never said I didn't). 1. Although yes, gays don't have any obligation to change views, I think it's a desirable quality that everyone should possess. So yes, they don't have a set in stone obligation, but if they (any everyone) doesn't try to change the views of the public, it won't get done. 2. I think the problem lies in proscribing flamboyancy to ALL gays, as the parade does. Gay pride parade should be able GAY pride, not ""gays who act and dress this way"" pride. Most people who are gay don't dress in boas and assless chaps, and it stereotypes. 3. Women who go on television wearing nothing aren't representing women, or straight people, just a company.

cavr4im	We know that life has come into existence at least once, obviously. We also have learned through scientific studies that life on earth can exist in very harsh climates. We know that there are billions of stars in our galaxy, of which a very good amount have planets. Even in the tiniest percentage of the exoplanets we've actually looked at, we've found dozens of planets that are located within their stars habitable zone - meaning that liquid water could exist. Multiply that by the billions of other galaxies in the universe. Even if the chance for life existing was a minuscule fraction - say one in ten billion - there would still be at least millions of planets with life. Likely very many with intelligent life as well. It's true that nothing can be proven without evidence. However, if we look at this probability, it's very difficult to deny the most probable existence of life elsewhere in the universe.

His overall legacy would be negatively impacted by something that happened without him on the field. A lot of people would say ""yeah well Brady did everything he could to put his team in a position to win"" but then someone could make roughly the same argument that you're making for why he shouldn't be in the discussion.

chcju9m	Well, if the definition holds that intoxicated people cannot give consent, I certainly did rape my wife. As in my edit, she would also be a rapist. So, I think OP has a point that something is wonky about this all inclusive idea of rape that isn't actually all inclusive.	Huh, you keep saying you and your wife raped each other without giving context. At this point, I'm assuming you mean that you and your wife have sex while drunk. First off, being intoxicated nullifies consent; it's a legal fact. However, nobody is arguing that having a few drinks invalidates consent but being close to passed out does. The level of intoxication needed to invalidate consent is pretty close to the point where the person can no longer be an active participant. Second, there are levels of implied consent within relationships and marriages. 	0.9949767850941174	0.5032583347756457	2.6666666666666665	1.4444444444444444	3.888888888888889	neutral	0.7777777777777778	6	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	8	1	0	9	0.8888888888888888	expert	0

ccnr582	My reasoning for this is pretty simple. The main prerogative of a human's life [Edit: a living being's life] is to avoid death, at all costs. Therefore I can assume that anyone wishing for death needs mental help, and is certainly not in their right mind. I do feel that people in extreme, unsolvable physical pain should be allowed to die, however. There is a threshold which they would need to reach, and hopefully an age limit. This way, 100 year olds writhing in pain on the hospital bed may be euthanized, but only with their/their family's permission. Children born with a condition, however, should not be allowed. This is because I feel that there is hope that their illness will be cured in their lifetime, or very soon. This law does not apply to indirect suicide, such as refusing cancer treatment or not getting various inoculations. Please, CMV	"&>> The main prerogative of a human's life is to avoid death, at all costs. This is an assumption, and the basis of your argument. What you *think* has very little bearing on anything.

ccwebj2	People have been making a lot of fuss about nuclear power. However, I don't think it's a problem. We've had two accidents in nearly two thirds of a century of production. One was caused by human error, and the other was caused by an earthquake and a tsunami. Chernobyl's errors had been corrected by then, but they were just not implemented there. And in Fukushima, the situation that caused it caused more deaths than the accident. They were both preventable, too. One was human error and the other was negligence. Oh, and the waste. It's better because it breaks itself down, unlike CO2 and other problematic substances. Not only that, soon there will be reactors that don't output any radioactive waste. This is much better than coal and gas, which leave permanent, damaging waste. Not only that, but iirc it has less casualties per TWh produced than any other fuel source. So I don't see why it's so bad. CMV. 	"The biggest problem is that safe nuclear power is expensive. It might play a role in providing the base load power supply, but it would have a lot of trouble competing with natural gas even if carbon emissions were taxed heavily.

cbi2yto	"So let me get this straight: 1. Men own children, and women lose control of them when they become of age = Patriarchy 2. Women get children, and men have few rights to them = Patriarchy Look, they number one problem I have with Feminism is Patriarchy makes no fucking sense because it just seems to mean ""However the world is right now = Patriarchy"". Do you think MRAs or men in general want women to get children more often? Hell no. Every definition of Patriarchy I've seen falls down in the face of all of the societal inequalities in favor of women (not saying there aren't any in favor of men) and it seems like just saying ""Things are unequal"" is both more accurate and useful, instead of blaming some bogeyman.

To me it seems there's a point when the major players can amass enough money to do things like cut off the supply lines for competitors and utterly destroy the little guy. How does the ""Free Market"" prevent that? According to the Bot, that above isn't long enough...sooo... 1) Why I believe this way: It's simple greed...Corporations are built to make money. Without regulatory measures preventing Monopolies, I don't understand how the Free Market would self correct. "	So... I have a staunchly libertarian coworker, and I asked him that once. He didn't try to claim that it wouldn't happen... instead he said that there's nothing wrong with monopolies, and that there isn't a single example of a monopoly that didn't become a problem without government influence.

cg61mop	I would say that JRR Tolkien is recent, and made huge strides in fantasy. I would say that Ray Bradbury, again, is an example of a huge step in fiction in general. Looking across the ages, there have always been authors who step up and challenge the current art conventions, and those that embody those conventions to a masterful degree. They are invariable men.	J.R.R. Tolkien didn't contribute anything to his genre. His work is pretty detailed with a lot of backstory but he took a lot of his themes from already-established mythology and simply used a cookie-cutter theme of good triumphing over evil. Many failry tales from the Miedieval ages used such a theme, where the hero is reluctant to leave and is eventually coaxed into going, eventually returning triumphant with a whole lot of stuff in the middle. Using Propp's fairy tale outline, you can plug at least TWO events in the LOTR into each of the 33 categories. The argument that males contribute a lot more is, in my opinion null, because no one has actually contributed much in terms of themes of genres for hundreds on hundreds of years. 	0.1824590879026603	0.9910760598382222	2.555555555555556	1.2222222222222223	3.6666666666666665	neutral	0.7777777777777778	5	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	3	1	9	0.5555555555555556	expert	0

"It's really not obvious though, because it's nearly impossible to quantify the value of those situations.

cmqs54o	At least in my state, 1.0 Fine Arts credits are required to graduate high school, equivalent to two semesters. I don't believe high school students should be required to complete and pass a fine arts class because: * The grading is qualitative, rather than quantitative. This means you're forced to take a class with the risk of lowering your GPA based on subjective standards for art set by the teacher. * Quality art takes skill, the possession of which relies on prior experience. How can you grade someone who has played an instrument or acted in plays since they were a small child on the same scale as someone who has not had the privilege of doing either? * In the marketplace, art's value tends not to be based on the amount of time taken to create it. The classroom setting is the opposite, where you can be marked down for a late art project. This means that fine art does not appeal to school's goal of career readiness.	Consider school as the formation of complete human beings that need meaning and meditation rather than a launchpad for future careers- you may find an answer to why fine art is required. That being said grading in an art classroom should be about personal effort- measuring and individual's growth/enthusiasm against their background. Many who consider themselves unartistic preemptively decide their lack of interest in the arts and so stand to gain as little as have they predicted. 	0.9574065804763142	0.7642045065086203	2.888888888888889	1.3333333333333333	3.7777777777777777	neutral	0.7777777777777778	4	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	8	1	0	9	0.7777777777777778	negative	0
chckszd	I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' don't exist. Not that I advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society -murder, theft, rape, etc- all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.

cq6pcyl	Abstains aren't a necessary part of Range voting, and it functions quite well without it. But I'd argue it's better with it. Quorums can be used in two ways to deal with this issue; Hard: Require a minimum number of votes. Soft: Give all candidates X number of 0 scores to start them off. This forces the issue and prevent stealth candidates taking the win. Another thing that's important to note is that studies show that a lot of voters, will just give an unknown candidate a 0 instead of an abstain, creating an automatic soft-quorum. 	I think a quorum could be problematic, since it might give the one deciding on the threshold too much power. But I'd agree with the system, if you'd remove the possibility to abstain. What I'd like to ask you is how you'd determine (and as how important you see) the exact range. Wouldn't a simpler system that just allows you to give either 1 or 0 (in other words yes or no) do almost equally well and avoid unnecessary difficulties? Or wouldn't you want the range to be any number between 0 and 1 (although some funny persons might give scores like 1/pi)?	0.6238009082183369	0.9910760598382222	3.0	1.3333333333333333	3.555555555555556	neutral	0.7777777777777778	6	0.586	0.5275555	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	1	3	9	0.5555555555555556	expert	0

ccrli77	I think you need to see using a gun for what it is, a relatively push button method for death. Different than arranging to hang oneself, swallowing dozens of pills, or physically moving yourself to a ledge, I would think it would feel 'easier' to do to oneself than the others. Sudden, immediate, hopefully lethal. I don't agree that the article portrayed him 'searching' for a gun. Nowhere does it state how he got the gun for his first attempt, and it only says that he was seen with a gun in an alley, not who he talked to or where he got it from. We don't know if he owned that gun, bought it, borrowed it from a friend or stole it. I don't think you can 'blame a gun' for suicide. Guns don't make people kill people, people kill people, guns just make it easier and more successful for people who want to die to do it. No one is to blame but I would think that the suicidal person has the most control, and whatever they use is just a tool, no matter how it may alter the situation. 	&>>I think you need to see using a gun for what it is, a relatively push button method for death.

ccmbsu4	After meeting a unexpected pedophile, my view on pedophilia has been radically altered. I don't see why we need to criminalize pedophiles. The man i met was very rational and intelligent and knew that his urges weren't permitted by our society and would always act within constraints of law, yet if word got out of his urges, I'm sure the community would shun and probably attempt to incriminate him for his innate urges. Why is pedophilia looked down upon now, when it used to taken as commonplace not too long ago?	Pedophilia *is* morally wrong. Just because someone is rational and intelligent does not mean that they are morally right. A *different* question is whether we should punish urges as well as actions. The action should and is punishable by law. The urges should *not* be punishable by law, but they should be treated and controlled. Pedophilia is looked down upon because it is morally wrong to exploit people who are not mature enough to give informed consent to sex. Using a power/age/maturity differential to satisfy your urges at the expense of impressionable and immature people is morally wrong. Many things were commonplace in the past that are no longer commonplace, such as slavery.

And in most gaming circles, women are explicitly targeted (along with certain ethnicities such as hispanics) because they are easily identifiable from voice. Which results in them not taking part in voice chats or the community. Along with people who harass them even outside of the game. Again, it's not promoting a class ""above"" being insulted, but stating that everyone *should* be treated evenly and right now they are not."	0.9900495241112224	0.863120568566631	3.0	2.4285714285714284	3.4285714285714284	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0

The Weimar Republic and the current Basic Law system were introduced by foreign countries such as Britain, France, and the USA. So now do we need to always say that Germany has an Anglo-Franco political system? Somehow this idea of a ""Western"" political system has gotten stuck in our minds. At what point does Liberalism and Democracy become Japanese? It seems like if you aren't going to let Democracy and Liberalism become Japanese then you can't say that they are Western either. They are American or British or wherever you believe that liberal democracy first started. Basically my point is that it is arbitrary to call this specific political configuration 'Western'."	Mmm, yes, that's a fair point -- I do think that Japan has had or at least at some point will have had sufficient history as a liberal democracy for it to be Japanese. I think it probably already is. Even so, it was necessary for the West to force Japan into liberal democracy, which is where the Western element comes in.

cmg04kk	Knowledge requires the truth of a statement to be guaranteed. This means that it has to be utterly impossible for the statement to be not true. It is not possible to guarantee the truth of any statement. Even for statements that one cannot conceive as false (such as the Principle of non-Contradiction), there is no guarantee that from the fact that one cannot conceive the falsehood of a statement it follows that that statement is true. One cannot guarantee his own ability to reason, assume premises, draw conclusions, identify truth, etc. Even if it seems to me both that 2+2 has to necessarily be 4, and that whenever I put 2 plus 2 in the real world I end up with 4, I cannot be sure that I am not inherently designed in a way that forces me to believe falsehoods and misinterpret experiential data.	"You're referring to the universal uncertainty of premises. The notion is that any argument made may be cast into doubt by questioning the premises, and the premises for that argument, and that argument, and so on. However, I feel this is where we learn to glean true knowledge, from contingency. We cannot prove individual premises, this is true. However, we can make certain inferences based on the acceptance of certain premises. Therefore the Destartian problem, rather than being solved with the assumptive and unprovable ""I think"", is solved with ""*if* I think"".

Occam's razor applies here, God not existing is simply the most logical option to me, therefore God doesn't exist. Say, I have a dog that constantly barks for no reason. One night, I'm at home with friends and the dog barks. Someone asks me if there might be burglars. And I would say that's impossible. Even though it's possible the dog might be barking because of burglars, I know that's not true, because it's the millionth time I've heard him bark. So, it's possible, but I know it's not true, because it's improbable. Same goes for God, in my beliefs as an atheist.	That's a confusing analogy. What you're saying is that since P(dog is barking) = 1, that means P(there is a burglar|dog is barking) = P(there isn't a burglar|dog is barking). The dog barking tells you nothing about the presence of a burglar; the two events are not correlated in any way. Of course, if the dog isn't barking, that's good evidence that someone shot your dog in the process of burglarizing your house.	0.0134611490369941	0.9852281360342516	3.7142857142857135	2.142857142857143	3.0	neutral	0.4285714285714285	3	0.4697143	0.40314287	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	4	7	0.4285714285714285	GPT	0

Think of the differences that exist between people of different ethnic groups. We can look at race as a societal structure because those biological differences are the result of *social* influences. Decisions were made within the frameworks of economics and politics - social structures - that caused societies throughout history to split off and settle into new territory, causing them to eventually show different physical traits. How can you say for certain that the biological differences between men and women are the product of human evolution, when it's obvious that changes can take place in a shorter period of time than hundreds of thousands of years?

c8zi628	Alrighty, so the past couple of years I have enjoyed a good amount of time with Libertarian friends and teachers. I have had debates with them, and found that all of their arguments make some kind of economic sense, as they have used historical precedent to make their points, which I respect greatly. I also live and go to College in extremely conservative areas, leading to a lack of liberal thinking or decent examples why it wouldn't work. But as I turn more libertarian, I at the same time can't help but find glaring issues with it, a paradox I really want to solve. I also want to change my view because much of my family is liberal, and I have been very liberal previously. So, can anyone change my view on the libertarianism with cold, hard facts rather than emotional responses?	"Consider Classical vs Behavioral economics. In classical economics, we develop the supply demand relationship and assume that all people will always make the best rational decision, but anything that deviates from the models is a ""market failure."" In reality, the models don't necessarily reflect real life, so life is a market failure a lot of the time... think of oil/gas prices when there's massive speculation during a war. That would be an example of behavioral economics, where demand is driven by fear. How many examples can we think of where our emotions and impulse get the best of our economic decisions? **Did I really need that 55 gallon barrel of lube off amazon?** In reality, is everyone making the best most rational decision? Do people have the means to do that, such as time, desire and education? The question is which do you think reflects reality more?

I feel this amount of tax is oppressive, especially considering how tight my budget is.

I don't want to get too political here though, I'd like somebody to convince me that a person with my income should be expected to pay over 20% of that income to the government(s).	24% tax is incredibly low for the modern world. The amount you get from the government for that is enormous. 47k is more then the median in the US, and to be only paying 24% tax on that is very good.

The issue is not really that you are overtaxed, the issue is that you are probably under payed for the work you do and the super rich people and corporations are incredibly under taxed. 	0.9986974037881448	0.863120568566631	2.571428571428572	1.4285714285714286	4.0	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	2	1	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0
chvq5r9	&amp;#8710; You've changed my view on people getting gender swap surgeries. I never thought of it as and actual disorder because I was so worried about discrimination, but you made me agree with you. People should not be changing their bodies when they have a psychological disorder.	Just so you know, there's an important difference between gender dysphoria and most other body disorders. If you're anorexic, then it doesn't matter how thin you are, you'll still feel like you need to lose weight. Liposuction wouldn't treat the anorexia, it would just feed the symptoms. With gender dysphoria, the patient's entire problem is that they feel like they're the wrong gender. Non-surgical treatments are ineffective at alleviating the patient's distress. Gender reassignment surgery solves the problem. The patient doesn't continue to feel like they're the wrong gender. Their life is not negatively impacted by the surgery, and so their situation is strictly better than their pre-surgery state. 	0.9989114829467096	0.0	1.8571428571428568	1.4285714285714286	4.428571428571429	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	1.0	negative	0
cg8juhg	You would be correct if someone said that they know something doesn't exist. Believing and knowing are different things. I believe a supernatural being doesn't exist, but I don't know that for sure. So how am I making a claim on faith? You haven't demonstrated that I am claiming something on faith? My position is the most popular position among atheist. I have claimed that a supernatural being most likely does not exist. There is still a small chance that one does, and one could. This is why you need to distinguis the definition of knowing vs believing. This is why people use the terms gnostic/agnostic. This is why a majority of atheists are agnostic atheist. They lack a belief in a god, but without ultimate knowledge. We don't know if there is a god, but we don't believe there is. What am I taking on faith?	But doesn't belief/disbelief stem from knowing something about the situation? Why would anyone believe/disbelieve something when they have no knowledge to support it? I agree that the two are different but I don't think they are mutually exclusive.	0.9893328990846676	0.9852281360342516	3.2857142857142856	1.4285714285714286	3.0	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	4	2	7	0.5714285714285714	GPT	0
cd5uvjh	Bike lanes that take the place of a traffic lane can be costly in ways you might not think about. Less traffic lanes causes traffic to move slower, causing cars to pollute more and can also reduce the amount of traffic local businesses receive. 	So I hope you know that there's a sweet spot for car fuel efficiency, and that sweet spot lies between 35 and 55 mph and only drops a little at 25.^[1](http://www.mpgforspeed.com/) Here's a handy plot for you: http://www.mpgforspeed.com/fegov_graph.gif And let's not forget that one more person on a bike approximates to one less person in a car, and that reduces both pollution and fuel use.

c9b4xya	The UK has introduced academies and free schools recently, which are both schools funded by government and free for students, but with no government control of the curriculum. If these replaced most private schools, there would still be competition and alternatives. The difference would be that schools that did not charge fees would not be competing with schools that did.	In the United States, schools that charge fees do not receive money from the government. I went to a private school K-12th grade. Our teachers were paid significantly less than teachers at public schools and we had significantly less money per pupil than those in public schools did. Over 90% of my graduating class went to college.

cikuw9d	But how is a student supposed to graduate if they are not enrolled? Yeah, actual graduation costs are very low, but why shouldn't anybody be allowed to graduate, then? Assume that 30k per year for the ~12 years it takes to reach graduation, and you have $360,000. With this topic, one might consider whether or not the federal mandate *should* be in place. 	Uhm, because we live in a country that believes in equality, and if a state provides a system of public education, they have to provide it *to everyone.* It's not like students with disabilities don't benefit from education. If they weren't making progress, the school would have to change something to ensure progress was being made. Public schools are not babysitters. It's also not entirely accurate to just throw out those numbers. A lot of that money goes to mandated paperwork, new technology that everyone can benefit from, etc. A lot of it will also go to special textbooks and resources, but schools don't want to buy new books regardless of the program.

cegb41e	My case is that most facts taught in school are not retained in long term memory. They are only useful to the student up and until they pass the test, at which point they are almost instantly forgotten. I'm saying the standard educational model is a vastly, vastly inferior system to any other which prioritises logic, critical thinking, practical skills, imagination, creativity and problem solving. The question is, if we produced only exceptional students, who would do all the menial, dirty, dangerous and tedious jobs?	You need facts to work with. You can't be critical of something when you don't have material for comparison. For example, the claims that this or that particular god is the One True God get a their true weight when you can put the claims of the worshipers of all the other One True Gods next to them. Otherwise you're just reduced to doing a Pascal's Wager.

However, in my mind, there are only four options as far as the whole of gender options: male, female, mtf trans, and ftm trans. And, at any one point in time, each person is either male or female (or transitioning, but I don't consider that a separate gender). Also, I believe that the bathroom you use is what YOU think you look like. So, no matter how much you feel like you're a woman, if you have a beard, use the men's room. If you are sporting double ds, you should go to the women's room.(These are extreme examples) Feel free to CMV on anything I mentioned.	Science says you're wrong, so now what?

ciuvkpq	Both sides are trying to do the same thing to each other, ie. remove the other from what they consider to be their land, so there will be no good guys. The difference is that Israel *could* violently remove every single Palestinian from the area in a matter of weeks, but instead chooses to slowly exhaust the Palestinians by making Palestine awful, while the Palestinians want to violently remove the Israelis and have tried and failed multiple times. If I had to take a side, I'd pick Israel, if only because they've actually contributed to the world in meaningful ways and are distinctly less barbaric in their approach, but at this point taking any stand on Israel/Palestine as a Westerner is about showing which side of the political spectrum you're on, not the facts on the ground. 	It's true that Israel would never wipe out Palestinians but there could be other reasons than humanitarian concern. A large portion of the world already hates Israel; this would at the least give them an excuse to attack Israel. 	0.9891571383926226	0.9852281360342516	2.7142857142857144	1.5714285714285714	3.142857142857143	neutral	0.4285714285714285	5	0.4697143	0.40314287	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	3	2	7	0.5714285714285714	GPT	0

I mean, Hitchcock seems tame by today's standards and Kubrick might not impress younger viewers but that's just because everyone else borrowed from them and created further by starting from those standards.	That's exactly it. I often tell people the only way to listen to the Beatles is to imagine you've never heard any of the bands that came after them. If you can put yourself in that frame of mind, it's much easier to wrap your head around why some of their more popular songs are as popular as they are. Another problem some people don't seem to realize is the fact that the Beatles had a MASSIVE library of successful songs, and their songs are so universally loved that even if you don't like the Beatles, you've heard a solid two or three albums worth of their music over and over and over in the media.

cmau0bw	The GED program in a lot of states are a joke, they are so easy people who dropped at middle school could do it. I know some very dumb people who got their GEDs but most dumb people I know failed to graduate high school. Alternative schools are basically bullshit, if you screwed up in regular high school you get sent to fake high school where the work is easier. These programs just undermine the work of real high school graduates, makes a high school degree less meaningful. It inflates the number of high school graduates and does not address actual education. _____ 	"From your comments, it seems your concern is really that the GED, as it exists, isn't actually the equivalent of a high school degree, rather than that you have an issue with the underlying concept of a self-study alternative to high school. However, your only evidence is that people you think are ""dumb"" have passed the exam. Obviously, no one who doesn't share your social circle will be able to knowledgeably contest this. Do you have any other evidence that the GED standards are inadequate. Are there specific skills or sets of knowledge that you feel are required for successful completion of high school, but are not tested by the GED? From Wikipedia: ""The [GED] test is administered to a representative sample of graduating high-school seniors each year, about 30% of whom fail the test."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Educational_Development So, clearly, the GED tests at least some things that are not necessarily acquired through traditional high school completion. Do you have evidence that the reverse is also true? If so, why do you think that the skills demonstrated by a high school diploma are more important than those demonstrated by a GED?"	0.9989114829467096	0.0	2.4285714285714284	1.5714285714285714	4.428571428571429	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	1.0	expert	0
ccb94rb	Sorry to jump in here as well, but I think you've made an excellent point. &>> I'm fine with them being independent nations. [...] If they were really separate nations, there would be border crossings, visas, and immigration policies. Two out of these three things do exist in some form, and the third isn't necessary. Americans, and citizens of other countries legally admitted to America, are entitled to visit Native lands visa-free, but not to live there, and only to work there under some conditions. Neither permanent residence nor citizenship is available to foreigners in these countries--what immigration policy could be stronger? Foreigners (e.g., Americans) are given second priority in hiring in favour of citizens (i.e., tribal members). Granted, one is not required to show a passport to enter the country; however, you'll find equally little enforcement crossing from France to Monaco, or from Italy to San Marino or the Holy See. The sovereignty of these places is not in dispute. tl;dr: You've suggested a truly sovereign state would exercise control over who can live and work in that state; most Native reserves fit this criteria.	Sure, the EU is an interesting case. They're kind of a hybrid group of nations, where citizens can live and work anywhere. I think the sovereignty of these states isn't as clear as it used to be, and the lines may blur further as the EU ages. They're all tied together in so many ways already, including EU laws, EU high courts, and EU monetary policy. The key detail about the EU states is that the citizens are *equal*. We have a system where a select group has more rights than others, and that's not equality.	0.9986757345137404	0.863120568566631	2.571428571428572	1.5714285714285714	4.285714285714286	neutral	0.4285714285714285	5	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	2	1	7	0.7142857142857143	GPT	0
cdbp9z7	Ghetto culture today glorifies poor money handling, Racism, Sexism, Alcohol abuse, Gang membership and Poor parenting. How can the people who live in these conditions ever hope to rise out of them if they idolize bad habits? How would they be able to provide a future for their children if they don't raise them? How can someone be expected to be treated equally if they willingly become those stereotypes? Glorifying these habits only makes problems for everyone.

Ghetto culture is just the poor African American culture.

It can also make the baby vulnerable to unintended consequences of circumcisions done incorrectly, like the [baby who died of herpes in 2012](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/baby-dies-herpes-virus-ritual-circumcision-nyc-orthodox/story?id=15888618) and the horrific incidents of [botched circumcisions which sometimes lead to death](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2276006/Nurse-Grace-Adeleye-caused-baby-boy-bleed-death-botched-home-circumcision-walks-free-court.html). I have heard that men can potentially experience problems with their foreskin if they don't clean/take care of it properly, but it seems like this is not a big enough problem and does not occur enough to warrant circumcising infants. The only context in which I could understand having their infant circumcised is if they did so for religious reasons - Even then, I'm not completely OK with it.

But it's not quite so simple as deciding to have sex and just picking out a pretty stranger on the street to do it with. This is seldom an option. If someone just wants sex, with no relationship or serious consequence to follow, what should they do that would be more moral? Masturbate?	It's becoming increasingly easier to seek out casual sex that doesn't involve financial exploitation. Women never have to pay for sex with things like online dating out there, and men should be in that position too ideally. In the meantime, while these ideals aren't met, let's not exploit people.	0.9891571383926226	0.9852281360342516	3.2857142857142856	1.7142857142857142	3.2857142857142856	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	0.5714285714285714	expert	0

If we were to increase gas taxes it would not be roughly the same, since far more people buy gas than people who pay to use the toll roads/lanes."	These things are not impossible to figure out pricing for. Take surveys and data on how much gas consumption people regularly use. Use that data to set a reasonable tax on gas to generate set revenue X. Likewise, use surveys and traffic data to evaluate how many people use certain roads. Raise a toll road and charge a price with that data to see how much needs to be charged to pay for the entire road and again to generate set revenue X. Either way, you're going to be paying roughly the same amount. 	0.9986757345137404	0.863120568566631	2.571428571428572	1.5714285714285714	4.0	neutral	0.4285714285714285	4	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	2	0	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0
cevvpe5	"So, to begin with, yes, I do pirate all LOT of media. I also plan on continuing to do so. However, I don't see why sites like the Pirate Bay should have a right to exist. The fact is, downloading music or movies or anything else is taking something for free that someone else worked to make. Even if those people have ridiculous amounts of money, and even if piracy actually benefits them overall, I just don't see how its not stealing. Furthermore, I don't see how you can blame Hollywood or musicians for trying to stop it. Fact is, it is their material even if they are filthy rich, greedy, whiny asses. The only way, in my mind, to justify it is with some sort of ""Robin Hood"" argument that you are taking from someone with much to spare to redistribute to people who have less to spare. In the end, however, I still see it as the creators right to try to enforce laws that put an end to piracy. I would very much like for some to change my view, please help me out!"	I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but there are certain exceptions for when pirating is morally justifiable. It's when a physical/purchasable copy is just not possible to find anywhere. This can occur in two situations. One is that the material in question is so old or obscure that no stores or sellers have the media commercially available any more. The other is if regulations in your country have made the media in question illegal to purchase or own. These are cases when it's impossible to otherwise purchase the media, so there's no potential gain by content creators that's being bypassed here. [Granted, my opinion on piracy was pretty much influenced by this episode of Extra Credits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZv_lPwBFI).	0.9986974037881448	0.863120568566631	2.7142857142857144	1.4285714285714286	4.142857142857143	neutral	0.4285714285714285	5	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	1	2	7	0.7142857142857143	GPT	0
cdqtvea	When the topic of crimes against youth comes up, I find the main argument put forth as to why things such as sexual relations which are legal for adults are illegal for youth is because they are not intellectually mature enough to make those decisions. My issue with this is that the reasoning shouldn't disappear once they've been on this Earth for a certain amount of time. It is wrong for a 35 year old man to date a 15 year old as the 15 year old doesn't have the mental capacity to understand the decisions they are making. I agree with this, but in 3 years, if the now legal person wants to date the 38 year old man, they are perfectly free to do it. Why do we change the law when the reasoning behind the first law is still in place. The 38 year old is taking advantage of a young person who doesn't understand the situation. 	If this were the case, how the heck could anyone know ahead of time whether or not they would go to jail for a relationship? Right now, I know that if I have sex with someone under sixteen, I'll go to jail, and if I don't, I won't (not for that, anyway).

caephl2	"I have drawn, paint, and tried out animation. To me, these arts require practice to hone skill. I have see people who also do 3D art, I also believe this requires an immense amount of skill, to create something in ceramics or to sculpt something. To me, photographers point their cameras at something and take a picture. Maybe there are some settings here and there, to be adjusted for the occasion, but clicking a button at a lucky moment should not be called ""skill"". There are also people who call themselves professional photographers, which I assume, means they believe themselves to have a great deal of skill in photography. I do not think I am giving photographers a fair chance as artists and I would like someone to change my view on them."	I suppose it comes down to what you want to define 'skill' as. Simply learning how to operate a traditional SLR correctly, let alone artistically, takes a vast amount of time and concentration (those manuals are huge), in much the same way as learning how to wield the tools of any other art form. I mean, learning how to do something as simple as account for and calculate the desired amount of light in a photo can take hours. I could see an argument, perhaps, in photography necessitating less creative input than other art forms, or being less expressive, but even that is up to debate. Any one who is serious about creating an interesting and visually pleasing photograph will have given thought beforehand to their intent, and how best to communicate it through composition, subject matter, manipulation, etc. Then actually translating/realising this vision through the camera can be just as difficult as realising an idea through any number of other artistic mediums. 	0.998785685504514	0.5916727785823275	3.4285714285714284	1.2857142857142858	4.571428571428571	neutral	0.4285714285714285	5	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	0.8571428571428571	negative	0
clf7x6l	Well, sure, everything can hypothetically occur without religion, but patriarchal religions offer a focal point for men and women interested in these types of relationships. You're arguing that major religions offer nothing to women because these religions don't promote gender equality; I'm countering that gender equality is not important to everyone. Many women genuinely believe that they are more emotional and less logical than men because of their unique status as mothers/women, and that men are needed to be the decision makers. It goes beyond working husband and stay-at-home moms into a philosophy that views traditional gender roles as innate characteristics. What you (and I), as modern, liberal atheists see as the subjugation of women is seen by some old-fashioned, conservative religious men and women as an appropriate division of rights and responsibilities based on the unique gifts given to each sex. 	Well-written and thanks for expressing that so eloquently. I agree completely with you said and than you for emphasising the alternative philosophy of many women possess. Comprehending this conservative viewpoint is becoming more difficult today's age, however. Gender equal discourse is abundant with many questioning a new wave of feminism. I wonder how this will impact many female young adults that are ignorant of religion. Many find a higher powers.

c8sa4b7	Elder's aren't necessarily wiser or more intelligent (and sometimes don't even have *that* much life experience) so why are they automatically deemed to deserve my respect and admiration? 	There are levels of respect. Of course there is *personal* respect; i.e. when you respect a person for who they are, what they stand for, etc. Then there's respect for a *position*: You can respect the *office* of the President, the *position* of CEO, or a higher military member's rank without respecting them personally. With age comes mistakes, with mistakes comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom. We are all more or less biologically the same creatures, with the same urges and the same fallibility. Older people have generally already made the mistakes that younger people make, and have lived through the consequences of those bad decisions. Some choose to impart this wisdom upon the younger people by telling them what to do and what not to do. Again they make the mistake of explaining the rule, but not explaining the *reasons behind the rule*. As a result, the youngling disregards the lesson, seeing no purpose to following it -- But more often than not, the elder was right. Therefore many elders earn respect of *position*. Only those who can truly impart the lesson, and have it stick, have earned *personal* respect.	0.9986757345137404	0.863120568566631	3.2857142857142856	1.1428571428571428	4.714285714285714	neutral	0.4285714285714285	5	0.4697143	0.40314287	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	0	7	0.7142857142857143	expert	0

cbpewqx	I think that there is a definite double standard between men and women. I think that it's possible for women to objectify guys like Ryan Gosling and Channing Tatum, while, if a guy says that Carmen Electra is hot, he's a sexist pig. I think that women can hit men all they want, but if a man even pretends to hit a woman, he's seen as a monster. But I really don't think that pointing out this gender divide will solve this divide. I'm tired of guys complaining about how they can't use the C word while the lady-folks can use the D word. I'm also tired of women oogling men while men can't even look at a woman without being accused of being pigs. CMV TL;DR: There is a gender double standard, but shut up about it.

cag8gsj	I get that in the past it hasn't worked out this way, but that's almost always because of corruption. Without corruption (using an vague word intentionally) I believe that dictatorships can flourish. 	If you have the *right* dictator it is the best form of governance. However, there's no good way to insure the dictator is the right kind of dictator. Democracy isn't the best form of governance, but it is the best way to transition power. Say you have the perfect dictator. He is not corrupt, he does good by the people, he respects civil liberties, and the country prospers. What happens after his death? Does his son take power? What if his son's an entitled dick who doesn't care about anything but his own happiness? Is there a fight for power? That will eventually leading to the best fighter becoming leader, which has been shown to not be great for civil liberties. Not to mention the frequent bouts of civil warfare results in death and destruction. So we have elections. Not because elections are perfect or that they always elect the best person, but because its better than any other form of transferring power. Dictators aren't the problem, it's selecting *which* dictator is in charge that's the problem.	0.987255473525337	0.8112781244591328	2.625	1.25	4.0	neutral	0.75	4	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	1	0	8	0.75	expert	0
cq3mc0a	I'm actually not making that argument at all, what I'm trying to get at is that Utilitarianism is not commutative/reciprocal in all cases. This leads to conflicts in your moral calculus. In other words, if A killing B in self-defense is moral, then B killing A in self-defense can't also be moral, since all the variables are the same, except for the directed action of the killing. Whatever variables you use to justify the first case will work against you in the second case. 	You're using a standard Utilitarian counterargument that I've always found flawed. My response is that the rule is commutative in the application but not in the analysis. This optimizes for transactional simplicity (which, for pragmatic reasons, should be the priority) at the expense of analytical complexity. On average, the net outcome of the rule is positive, particularly when you account for second-order effects (eg, the general social instability created by decreased physical security). If there's a standard philosophical counterargument to my response, I'd love to hear it. This has always been something that's bugged me about the usual Utilitarian discourse, and I've never heard this particular argument made or addressed. What's wrong with recognizing the global net-benefit of a transactional rule, even if the local analysis of the transaction isn't symmetric?	0.816934238727247	0.8112781244591328	3.25	1.375	2.625	neutral	0.75	4	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	2	2	4	8	0.75	GPT	0

Ukraine decided to break apart from the Soviet Union, and that's fine; but if the Crimea doesn't want to be a part of the Ukraine and they win a referendum (2/3 majority) to become a part of Russia, I don't see anything wrong with that. To do otherwise, is extremely shortsighted in my view, because Ukraine is going to have a restive province on their hands with a powerful backer making a military crackdown/ occupation inevitable. Further down the road we may see something akin to an IRA develop. This blood will not only be on the hands of Ukrainians but the UN as well since they seek to deny them their democratic voice in the recent referendum.

Here is a state retrospective of the law written about 10 yrs later: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/propa_3172_7.pdf I can sum it up for you: It just made things worse for everyone. Now, even the districts with wealthy citizens don't have the money because the state does not distribute it to them.

ch6tasp	Hello there! This is my first time in CMV so before we go in I just want to say I mean no offense to anybody. So I believe Prostitution should be legal. First of all I figure that as long as all parties involved consent to whatever they plan on doing then it is okay. I also think that legalizing prostitution will allow more money to be generated through taxes, which can go towards funding schools, roads, ect. Finally I believe that legalizing prostitution might create a safer environment for those working as prostitutes. _____ 	This is simply encouraging the scum of society to continue being degenerates and may even lead to more women becoming prostitutes since they consider it a legitimate job. Prostitution can have truly terrible outcomes. Johns sometimes rape, abuse, and murder hookers. It's incredibly dangerous and risky. Legalizing prostitution counters the logic of the routine activity theory. Although motivation of offenders is difficult to manipulate, by increasing security and decreasing availability of suitable targets, it's hypothesized that crime rates can be lowered. Legalizing prostitution would completely eliminate security, since police will no longer be concerned with it, and raise the availability of suitable targets dramatically. Many claim prostitution is a victimless crime, but legalizing it would quickly prove it is anything but that.	0.0017467802003367	0.954434002924965	3.25	1.875	3.0	neutral	0.75	4	0.367125	0.413375	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	3	1	8	0.375	GPT	0

ck3u8mn	Obedience to authority figures solely on the grounds that they are authority figures is a moral failing that reduces a person to moral bankrupcy and animality. If one is instructed to carry out an act, one must question the act upon its merits. Delegation of moral responsibility to others is something that befits a cringing coward, not a person with moral agency. Little Eichmanns who *do* delegate their moral responsibility to others are less than human and should be treated with the contempt they deserve. The only right course of action for an individual is to strive to understand what is right and wrong, and to direct one's actions in a manner that is maximally conducive to the right. Any less is a shameful failing. Those incapable of this act are '*less than*', deprived of a fundamental moral faculty that moral agents must possess. It is an overvalued concept that is embraced and cultivated by religions like Christianity, and preserved by those of a regressive and conservative persuation. Obedience is only a virtue to fascists, cryptofascists, totalitarians and authoritarians and those lacking the ability or courage to proclaim their concept of right and wrong and act in accord with it. 	If my boss tell me to do something, as long as it fall within the limits of my job, I will do it. It doesn't matter if I agree with him or not. He is doing his job and I'm doing mine.

You don't necessarily agree with him, but you realize that on this particular subject, this person knows a lot more than you do, therefore you will follow what he says. Even if you disagree, that's not a flaw.

cc3w0zk	It's simple. It makes the game takes less time. It stops arguing over when the clock should be started or stopped, something that is annoying in several North American sports. It's nowhere near the referee's largest impact on the game, so it's not a big deal. It subsumes the ambiguity of when a play ends and restarts after an injury or while the ball is controlled by the keeper. It makes the last minutes more unpredictable and so more tense. Also when you say that it takes 6 or 7 minutes to take a free kick, you are exagerrating by about an order of magnitude.	In North American sports, clock arguing is a complete rarity in general, and most arguments are very substantial since we have video footage to go off of. Also, if you define rules of when and where the clock should and shouldn't be stopped and let the referee blow a whistle to stop the clock in those situations, then there is no ambiguity. The big difference between the two is transparency. Everyone has full knowledge of the situation and the decisions of the ref are much more obvious. It also removes much human error.	0.9672574551790888	0.8112781244591328	1.875	1.125	3.75	positive	0.75	7	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	0	1	8	0.75	expert	0

cnxh0kn	"Homes are destructive to the planet. In current ""modern"" times, when we have somehow forgotten that we originate from millions of years of evolution as a homeless species, we seem to think that every single person now needs to be kenneled up inside a home. Why? At the same time, global warming continues running rampant, and 80% of the planet has been deforested, hundreds of species of precious life are being driven into extinction, along with all of the other ecological and humanitarian disasters being driven by the householding gluttony. What other primate species are living in homes? Or anything even close to resembling that behavior? If we go by today's regulatory standards of what constitutes a ""legal"" home, the continent of North America was largely ""homeless"" up until only a handful of generations ago, this change from homelessness to McMansionism also coincides with the ecological destruction that has subsequently taken place. This fleeting degree of material comfort is not a worthwhile trade off for destruction of the planet, and society's addiction to housedwelling needs to be abandoned.

Because in saying 'yes' and 'no' you're assuming you have knowledge on a subject that, from what I know, is impossible to come to a conclusion on. This isn't just Christians by the way- this all people who believe in god. Now, I can see where both sides come from. The idea of a Christian God is sometimes flat out ridiculous. But so is the claim that someone knows that in an incomprehensibly large universe, throughout infinite amount of time, there wasn't anything that had a part in creating it? Also somewhat self centered to assume you have an idea. TL:DR- I think the only appropriate response to if you believe in God or religion is 'I don't know' because as humans it's all speculation. Both sides have points, but to be so firm in your beliefs makes you arrogant, as you assume you know something that is impossible to know.

coxx2nf	I don't know THAT much about houses so please educate me and try to change my view. There's the stigma of buying a house around 30, then your standard 30 year mortgage. So your buying an **expensive** house that you will pay off until your 60 or so. There's so many things that could go wrong, where you might not have a steady income for the full 30 years. Then you have to pay for gas, electricity, heat, and water which isn't a fixed amount. Why shouldn't the stigma be live in what you can afford. Rent apartments will all utilities included and have your landlord pay for any repairs. And save that extra money to actually travel instead of being stuck paying for a house for 30 years and worry about maintaining it when a home is just where you sleep and eat and work and a social life keeps you outside for at least 12 hours a day.

I keep hearing ""this could have happened to anyone, I can't believe our society would let this go unpunished."" What would the protesters have ""us"" do? If anything, the state was overzealous in its prosecution of Zimmerman (i.e., charging second degree murder) and a JURY found him not guilty?

Instead, it is evidence the government will go too far in prosecuting these crimes because of the intense political pressure brought to bear.

I still think that it should be illegal to drive while talking on a cell phone or with an unrestrained animal (Such as your little dog) in the car, because those people are driving distracted which could case them to crash into an innocent bystander. I think society would be better off if the type of person that doesn't wear a seat belt or helmet would just die off. Change my view.

cl3i9vt	The US has several interests in the South China Sea. There is regular economic transport through the region, and they have several allies whose national defense and economics are based on their presence in certain regions of the SCS. Yet the US has almost no involvement, as they are allowing a regional hegemon (China) to dominate politics related to the US and its regional allies. The risk of losing access to free economic movement in the South China Sea can be greatly detrimental to many US allies, mostly due to the fact that parts of the South China Sea see more energy (Oil) related shipping traffic than the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal, and therefore should be a higher priority for the US. However, because the US is losing global dominance, they are opting to refrain from involvement in the political conflict. 	There is somewhat of a major factor in all of this that you never brought up. America trades with China. A lot. That's why, for the most part, we have stayed on the sidelines with this issue. America values its trading relationship with China. Then again, it values its trading relationships with all the countries in this struggle. Why would we take sides?

Thus, it makes more sense to kill a violent offender than to waste a bunch of money on keeping him alive in prison. I don't see how that benefits society. I realize that through the appeals process the death penalty can become quite costly, but that's another matter entirely. In theory, it seems more rational to execute a violent offender.

If you want to have a talk about whether or not it is more ethical to execute people or keep them locked up forever, that's fine, but I think that's a different talk then whether it is more practical.

ci7sgmb	But schools are not analogous to that situation. Schools don't allow self defense at all in many places in the USA, so a better analogy would be if there was a proposal to eliminate the legal right to self-defense. If you aren't allowed to defend yourself, you have to wait for and trust the teachers/police, but this response takes far to long to actually stop bullying/crime in progress. The only thing schools/courts can do is punish offenders, but only those offenders who are proven guilty. If dedicated bodies of trained personnel are so much better, then do you support eliminating the right to self defense? 	I'm not advocating eliminating the right to self-defense, so I'm really not on the hook for that entire second paragraph. My argument is that insisting that everybody do everything for themselves (self-defense, self-diagnosis, etc.) eventually makes everybody completely ineffectual. And OP has not showed how the argument does not apply to all these other self-activities. (Edit: if you replace bullies with cancer or giardia, you see how ridiculous the argument becomes. Yes, if you can diagnose and treat yourself that'd be neat, but not everybody _can_, no matter how many times you hit them with cancer or giardia. Sometimes, you need external help.) Essentially, the argument was that everybody can eventually learn to do these things for themselves and will be better off for it. So why does it apply to bullying and not all these other things?

cbn1pwa	"I'm not referring to some sort of god-based determination. It seems to me that the view of causal determinism is pretty much true. Any action that we take results from prior causes, which, in turn, resulted from prior causes. Any thoughts that one has are a result of chemical reactions in the brain that exist because of a prior state. There's also the studies that have surfaced in light of Libet et al's tests a while back. From what I've read, the brain functionally decides what the body is going to do before a persons thoughts catch up with their actions. Change my view. P.S. Let's not make this a ""God exists"" discussion, we'll save that for another CMV."	Your mental model of the physical world is not necessarily correct - we know for sure the determinism fails in certain situations. We have personal experience of our own consciousness that suggests there is more to understand about the universe - we can't explain consciousness without something more than current physics. So the basis of your reasoning (a deterministic world) is incorrect - the world is not known to be a turing computer and we have (non-scientific) hints that it might not be. Libet etc.. changes little - we know the brain is physically the centre of cognition, and that people are not independent from it - it is no surprise that multiple areas contribute to the outcome of an effect. The experience of consciousness is certainly layered - so to have free will doesn't necessarily mean that decisions have to be taken at the highest layer.	0.9917250889471378	0.8112781244591328	2.125	1.375	3.0	neutral	0.75	4	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	3	2	3	8	0.75	expert	0

cedvdlz	I am an avid smoker and have yet to experience any negative side effects from smoking Marijuana. Now I know that that is not representative of all smokers but it is only what I think based on personal experiences. As for the problems part, I seem to be under the impression that Marijuana sales will provide huge tax revenue and kick start our economy's reconstruction. I do spend a lot of time on /r/trees so I am most certainly biased. I'm sure there are underlying problems and I am open minded to the negative aspects of this drug. Thanks. Edit: Sorry I was exaggerating a bit in the title when I said all the problems in the world. I really meant the U.S. financial issues.	Alcohol is arguably the most widely used drug in the US. In 2011, it brought in a whopping $6.2 billion in federal tax revenue. [http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=399](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=399) The federal budget was in the neighborhood of $4 trillion. The deficit was around $1.5 trillion. That means alcohol taxes paid off about .15% of the federal budget and a matching contribution from marijuana sales (I find that to be an optimistic projection) would offset about .4% of the deficit. I agree that pot should be legalized, but taxes from it won't solve our problems.	0.9975963523320812	0.0	2.375	1.125	3.875	neutral	0.75	5	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	1	8	1.0	expert	0

cacfxws	It's completely logical for there to be a flat tax rate for all people, not a higher rate for people who make more. It doesn't seem fair, nor does it make sense that people get different rates based on how much money they make.	First, make sure that you understand marginal tax rates. Your tax doesn't magically jump to a higher percentage when you go over a threshold; it's only the part *above* that threshold that's taxed at the higher rate. This was one of the frustrating things in the Bush tax cut debate: cutting taxes for under $250k is a tax cut for *everyone*, because it also lowers rates for the first $250k that rich people make. Second, look up diminishing returns. The first $50k is way, way more important than the entire second million. Income tax brackets are meant to be calibrated so that the loss is approximately the same for everyone, once adjusted for the value of that marginal dollar. The fact is that the country can't function if everyone pays a tax rate that someone making $30k can survive, and people making $300k can spare a lot more before it hurts.	0.9975963523320812	0.0	1.75	1.125	4.5	neutral	0.75	5	0.367125	0.413375	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	7	0	1	8	1.0	expert	0

Given that constraint I do not believe that democracy can provide for freedom - instead it provides an impetus to ""follow the herd"", or at least not to stray too far. I further believe that nations have been able to protect individual liberties to the extent that they dilute the democratic nature of the system - with safeguards like elected officials with fixed terms, unelected judges, etc. The majority of social movements that increase liberty (civil rights, slavery, etc etc) have generally been imposed through such counter-democratic methods. They usually faced strong majoritarian backlash at the time - and I believe in a pure democracy they would not have happened. Change my view."	It protects the majority of people's freedoms. It protects the freedoms that the people want to have protected, in general. If your freedoms are niche enough that they aren't accounted for in the majority's desires, then yes they are probably not going to be protected. However, the major freedoms like the ones you listed above (civil rights, slavery, women's rights) all came about because they had a significant movement behind them. Starting with Women's rights, at least 50% of the population supported women's rights because about 50% of the population was women. Slavery was a similar case, sympathetic whites and a strong black minority were able to overthrow the minority of people who wanted to hold slaves. The reason that slavery experienced such a backlash from the democratic majority was because only white men were part of the democratic process, as the rest has their ability to vote suppressed.

cgvlhrb	I get that biologically speaking teenagers prefer more sleep and aren't naturally inclined to wake early. However, pushing the school day further and further back will only cause more problems than solve them. * By starting school later, you are ending school later because schools require a certain amount of time every day. Instead of starting from 7:30 to 2:00 school runs from 8:30 to 3:00. * If you're getting out later then you're staying up later doing homework to the point that there is no difference in the amount of hours slept. * Not everyone comes home and plays Pokemon all day. Some kids have extracurriculars. Activities like sports, clubs, jobs, and volunteer work can now easily run into the night. In fact some parents may dislike the idea of kids being out so late (among it being inconvenient) that they're unable to participate anymore and this will hurt their chances of getting into college in the future 	Here in the UK, children amd teenagers start school at half 8 or 9. I don't see any issues with it. One school even extended starting time till 10 and they found an improvement in student grades and satisfaction. For those that get up early, it meant that they could get on with more work before school. For those who got up a bit later, they could get an extra hour sleep. One question for OP is why should school start at the very beginning of the day? Why can't it start just a little bit later when students feel a bit more ready for it?

ch6ku0s	In the case where a child has been effectively raised by a grandparent, why would the grandparent not simply petition/sue for custody?	On what grounds? Our assumption based on your post is the parents are *fit.* It is very, very hard to take kids away from fit biological parents. There are a lot of legal presumptions in their favor, including the one that parents make decisions in their child's 'best interests' re: visitation decisions. May I ask which cases you're referring to? The ones you heard on the radio? Sometimes legal reporting can be kinda shoddy and misleading. Also, I guess I'd ask why grandparents categorically shouldn't have any rights. It might just boil down to a standing issue, where there's no per se right to visitation but grandparents are allowed to sue and have their case heard on the merits in court, since most of these cases are decided on a case-by-case basis. Many grandparent visitation statutes provide clear contours for justiciability (which just means you get to talk about the substance of your claim rather than being booted out of court for not being a proper party who has suffered some redressable injury.)	0.9892251683508922	0.7642045065086203	3.4444444444444446	2.0	3.6666666666666665	positive	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5362222	0.4718889	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	8	1	0	9	0.7777777777777778	expert	0

Are you a rationalist in the philosophical sense? My impression was that you though that experimentation and the scientific method were necessary tools for generating true statements, not that evolution could be deduced by pure reason a priori.

civgg8q	"Most likely not. In regards to representation, the problem is not with the district composition, but with the districts themselves. Additionally, gerrymandering doesn't aim homogenous district. The perfect ""gerrymandered"" (I'm not sure that's a word) district would *assure* 51% of the vote for Party A and 49% for party B. The objective is to assure a win without concentrating your supporters too much; if you make your district homogenous, you're ""wasting"" 49% of your votes on a single district. "	may I just post to you my reply to a similar post. its the only way I have if I want to keep up :p While it's true that gerrymandering is indeed abusive. in that it's the active attempt by the political parties to shape the districts so that their victory is guarantied. Then i stipulate that what is needed is not less gerrymandering but more. That with both parties, and if we're luck other parties, fighting over the shape of the districts we should end up with divisions that allow for a more accurate representation. Abuse is what happens when one side is allowed to run uncontested. the best, no the only way to stop it is with active competition from other forces.

cl4rjs4	A good Naturopathic doctor does not advocate acupuncture instead of radiation. They prescribe it in conjunction with normal medical treatments. I have an Aunt who have been battling Ovarian Cancer for over 5 years. She sees both an Oncologist who prescribes radiation and chemo treatments, and a Naturopath who does acupuncture, massage etc. Naturopaths are more concerned with a holistic approach to medicine, whereas regular doctors are more concerned with just treatment of a disease. Her Naturopath does the other treatments because she knows that in order for my Aunt's body to fight well, she needs to be as calm and rested as she can be, and mentally rejuvinated to fight. The regular doctor doesn't nomally think past medical treatments. 	That's fine if you want to use it in conjunction.

cbs5bjc	This is a common assumption in todays society and I can't think of any reason why it is right other than the fact that I can't think of any reason it's wrong, so why not? In other words, unless there are good reasons that mutually consenting adults shouldn't engage in an act, then there is no reason why we should voluntarily prohibit ourselves from engaging in such actions. The second part is that since there are no good reasons for us to inhibit our number of sex partners, therefore a person who negatively judges any individual (even silently) is wrong in their judgement. Remember, this is all based on assumption that the person is engaging in safe sex.

cq1zyrk	Great response as to why 'retarded' is considered offensive. The issue with other words has less to do with etymology and more to do with the fact that 'idiot' and 'moron' were once actual diagnosis used in medicine. As far as I know, 'silly', 'absurd','fool', etc. were not. Since 'retarded' is now obsolete as well, shouldn't all outdated words for developmental issues be treated the same?	"Well ""retarded"" is being phased out of clinical use, but I suspect it will take a few years to take effect. Various state governments will have to change language and what not, for school districts to get one board, and for other organizations and charities to catch on, and so forth. However, I have no theoretical objection to the word being used in a casual way in the future. If it's no longer widely used as a clinical term then I don't have a problem with it used casually. I think that might take a few years though. Edit: and I disagree that the issue with ""moron"" and such is not etymology, so much as applying special etymological significance to outdated clinical terms because they were once clinical.

ca6kcpr	I feel like people in this subreddit are too quick to change their views. I like to think most of my opinions on important issues are carefully considered, and it would take a truly comprehensive and thoughtful discussion for me to consider changing my mind. And yes, I realize the irony of this post...but I'll be open minded.	Speaking algorithmically, many of your carefully considered and well-informed issues can likely be decided by a single bit of information: any given position is going to have a series of assumptions and contingencies and if any of those are different (true where you thought false, or false where you thought true), your position will change in some direction or another. And it does this for precisely the reason that you claim it can't easily change: because you've carefully considered what dictates your positions. If you learn something new about what dictates your positions, your mind will dictate new positions for you to take. And that's not even including the possibility that someone could point out an assumption that you had, but didn't *realize* you had, dictating your position. You might challenge such assumptions yourself, thus doing most of the work of changing your own views. Indeed, I would assert *any* considerate, thoughtful argumenter is going to be doing most of the work of changing their own minds themselves!

Personally I have already took peace with the fact that I, unless I live forever or religions where right after all, will never live in a world that is fair. But let's go hypothetical: what if nobody cared about things being fair, socially accepted, or anything like that: If we would set up strict rules that say only the best of society remain. For example: -If you have down syndrome or simular, you may not reproduce -If you have or had any kind of mental illnesses, you may not reproduce. -The same thing for: suicidal people, weak people, ill people, dumb people: imperfect people. I ask myself, demon as I am, this might even be a good idea. If you want the human race to evolve quick, this is the way.

Being nice and kind to all people makes it much easier to work together to make technology, and as such, eugenics for disabled people is likely to make society less stable and slow down evolution.	0.0837682223035837	0.9910760598382222	2.6666666666666665	1.4444444444444444	3.555555555555556	positive	0.5555555555555556	4	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	2	2	9	0.5555555555555556	GPT	0
cbgamua	I hear of this issue most often in schools, where a transgender person uses the 'wrong' bathroom and people get upset. Here is an example: http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2013/06/24/transgender-first-grader-wins-right-use-girls-bathroom I think that ideally, bathrooms should be gender-neutral but for some reason that isn't reality so let's deal with what we've got. Bathrooms are physical spaces with different toilets corresponding to the anatomy of the user. It doesn't make sense that a male-identified person with a vagina should have to use a [go-girl] (http://www.go-girl.com/) or some other special device in order to use a urinal when it's not made for that person's anatomy in the first place. Men can wear dresses, women can grow beards, I don't care. What matters to the bathroom as a physical space is the anatomy your body uses to relieve itself. Certainly there is a small minority of people who have some indistinguishable genitalia, but in the safety of a bathroom stall, no one will know anyway.	I don't really care who's in the bathroom with me. As long as no one tries to talk to me or make a mess in a public bathroom they can do whatever they want. This whole argument seems silly.	0.0011565003533703	0.0	3.4444444444444446	1.8888888888888888	1.2222222222222223	neutral	0.5555555555555556	1	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3	3	9	0.0	negative	0
cmnolkz	But plenty of incredibly popular social websites already ban hate speech and they're fine. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube all ban most hate speech.	And I think you'll find people that dislike that behavior immensely. Actually Facebook is notorious for acting on the words of users who report things alone without investigating them. Heck, I got temp banned for posting an image of Aaron Rodgers and Clay Matthews heads superimposed over Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke's heads during their VMA performance.

cldw28c	&>> Using historical examples, they push the idea that whites hate blacks and Hispanics. Democrats also want blacks and Hispanics to blame their personal/group failures on whites (even when it isn't the case). They aren't usually using historical examples, there's plenty of recent examples that are used to point out racism and bigotry of white people against minorities. The big difference is Democrats pointing out existing racism while Republicans tout xenophobia. The images of the poor leaching off the white taxpayer are provable false, this is not so of the image of the racist republican who believes these things.	So, are you saying that Democrats are correctly pointing out reasons for blacks to fear whites, and that these reasons are generally fair examples without much exaggeration?

cb59v7i	Our leaders need to be able to deal with the ever increasing complexity of our technology, economy and society. Therefore, I think, it should be mandatory that every politician goes through several years of education in undergraduate level mathematics (especially statistics, formal and informal logic, calculus), a technology/engineering related field, economics and ethics. As a result prestige wouldn’t arise from origin, charisma and eloquence anymore, but from honesty and clear, intelligible logic.	"The biggest part of leading is getting people to follow you. That's why charisma is so important in our leaders. A genius can come up with the greatest plan in the world but if he has no charisma no one is going to believe him and put it into play. It sounds like what you really want is for us to be governed by charismatic leaders whose advisors are all ""scientists"" (though I'm not sure economists qualify as scientists). Then the leaders can use their charisma to get people to do what they ""scientists"" believe they should do. And that's mostly what we do today. That is part of why what politicians say on the campaign trail differs greatly from what they do after being elected. Their advisers point out all of their unworkable plans and the smart politicians break those promises."	0.188401666711783	0.9910760598382222	3.0	1.2222222222222223	3.4444444444444446	neutral	0.5555555555555556	5	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	3	2	9	0.5555555555555556	GPT	0

Every one of these goods would be taxed as a consequence of their creation. Further, the act of the government going to your house and taking 4/20 bananas is not a sufficient distinction to prove theft given your definition that taxes aren't theft if the elected representatives create the law.

It would only be theft in your definition if they did it against the law, in which case tax could never be theft for you by simply raising the percentage."

cmd8966	This would serve the dual purpose of holding cops accountable in the event of fuckery, and vindicating any use of force if justified. I can see zero reason why this would be a bad idea. It's insane to me that we have no problem with traffic cameras at every intersection, but still allow cops to do their thing with no accountability. Ideally I see it going down like this: dash cameras and body cameras on every cop. Footage is captured and stored by a 3rd party and can only be retrieved with a court subpoena. Hard to believe good cops aren't already wearing cameras just for their own protection. CMV 	"Do cops need to have body cameras on when they're doing paperwork? I realize this sounds similarly trivial to the undercover cop case, but it is a little more nuanced than it looks. If a cop is getting out of their squad car to confront someone, they should have a camera. What if they're at the station? What if they're in the evidence room, where only cops and lawyers are going to be? What about if they're in a part of the building where civilians might pass through? What about when they're transporting someone to a prison? What if they're on their lunch break but still in uniform? What if they're part of the crime prevention department and are giving a presentation to the Neighborhood Watch group? What if they're interrogating someone in a room that is being recorded anyway; does there need to be a redundant body cam recording?

cejfnk0	In my life, I have seen a lot to support racial stereotypes. I know there are exceptions to every rule, and I do not consider myself a racist. However, I have seen some things which support a lot of the stereotypes here. I live in New Zealand where there are a lot of stereotypes against the Maoris. When i first came here i thought everyone was extremely racist against them. However, i have witnessed domestic violence, been robbed, physically attacked, and verbally abused by them. Whenever i go into a KFC, it is 90% full of them. These are just some examples to illustrate my point. I have friends who are maoris, don't get me wrong, and I have nothing against any specific person for being a certain race. However, on average, the race as a whole seems to its stereotype of being stupid, poor, quick to violence, and addicted to fried chicken. This is just one example of a race which is profiled in a certain way. There are many more groups of people which I believe to, on average, live up to their stereotype. CMV.	I'm unclear on exactly how one could change your view, or what part of it you're interested in changing.

cbptbxy	A lot of people, on the internet and otherwise, have some fairly valid reasons why marijuana isn't all that bad, and why it should be legalised. While I acknowledge that there is sound science behind some of these reasons, I think the fact that people are so keen on espousing marijuana's harmlessness is actually dangerous in and of itself. When people think something isn't 'all that bad', they tend to become complacent about it - look at alcohol and cigarettes - like marijuana, they're not the most medically dangerous of drugs, but they do more damage than all the others combined, not because of their physical properties but because **they're accepted**, and this is the same thing which makes marijuana a problem. Change my view?	How are you defining 'dangerous'? We can see scientifically it's not more physically dangerous than the other drugs, so what precisely do you mean? It's clearly not just that more acceptability == more danger, because there are drugs that are even more accepted (caffeine, aspirin) that are not more dangerous, so I think you need to clarify the 'danger' you're talking about.	0.9994498923381764	0.0	2.555555555555556	1.8888888888888888	3.111111111111111	neutral	0.5555555555555556	5	0.5362222	0.4718889	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	0	3	9	1.0	negative	0

Terrorism and Islamophobia are the same thing. Both result from a lack of understanding or hatred for a group with a different religion or ethnicity. Both result in violence. The only difference is the particular ethnic group or religion that the person hates. In saying this, there has definitely been a greater number of deaths and suffering caused by Islamic terrorists than caused by Islamophobes.	0.0496189599626503	1.0	3.0	1.5	3.125	negative	0.5	5	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	5	2	9	0.5	GPT	1

cqd70pt	Admittedly I don't have any deep knowledge of politics, but I believe that two-party systems are restrictive of free thought. They box people in and chain them to that specific set of beliefs, making them more closed minded to differing ideas, which in turn encourages disdain of the opposing party. It causes discord and discourages empathy and compromise. I understand the purpose of labels, but wouldn't it be more beneficial if there were more than two boxes to check? It's like people are given a multiple choice question, when the question would be better answered in an open-ended format. ~~This may be a long shot of an assumption, but it feels like a manipulation tactic to oversimplify complex issues in the eyes of the masses, in turn discouraging people to think for themselves. It's so much easier to control public thought when all you have to do is control two puppets who are seemingly in opposition, but have the same dirty end goal. It completely defeats the point of democracy. It's archaic and toxic to the populace.~~ Feel free to educate me and change my view. Edit: This video that /u/cp5184 shared accurately expresses my concerns with this system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo	It's an inherent issue with any system of governance because any given policy must be voted up or down, and there are systemic benefits to being the majority party beyond simply winning specific votes on specific issues. In the U.S being the majority means selecting the speaker of the house or president pro tempore of the senate. And that's huge power. In a parliamentary system, it's arguably even worse, since you get to select the prime minister if you have a majority coalition. So what ends up happening is that you still get two parties (look at Japan), it just happens after the election. And it makes sense, you wouldn't have the pro-life and pro-choice advocates on the same side even if they were two single-issue parties, so one will join the Labour Party, and one will join the Torries.	0.0170868356200943	0.9910760598382222	2.333333333333333	1.2222222222222223	3.111111111111111	neutral	0.5555555555555556	4	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	3	1	9	0.4444444444444444	expert	0

cmwn9t4	I don't think people are calling for a true [Jubilee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_%28biblical%29) but rather for student loans to be treated like other debts in bankruptcy. We do allow people who get over their heads in debt to get out from it through bankruptcy. Unless the debt arises from severe moral turpitude (e.g. OJ's debt from the lawsuit over killing Nicole Brown Simpson), it can normally be discharged in bankruptcy if your income is too low and you can show that you have no assets with which to possibly pay it. Your restaurant example is one where the debt would be bankruptable. Credit card debt is one of the most common debts to be voided in bankruptcy.	"The problem is that you can't repossess education. With the ability to keep the asset in its entireity but pay none of the charges for it, there's very little incentive to *not* take on a ton of student debt and then declare bankruptcy.

cpirae2	"A few years ago, the Indian government decided that certain cities bearing colonial names should henceforth be referred to by their precolonial names --- e.g. Mumbai instead of Bombay, Kolkata instead of Calcutta, Chennai instead of Madras, etc. The reason for the change was that some nationalistic parties gained political power and decided that this would be a good way to appease their voters. This change somehow caught on not only within India, but all over the world. It is enforced so extremely in India that the censor board recently decided to ban a music video simply for using the word ""Bombay"" instead of Mumbai. My problem with this is that no government (or any authority) should have a hegemony over the English language. One of the most beautiful things about the English language is that there is no authority in the world that can prescribe rules for it.

I'm asking if it is equally immoral for the Dallas Cowboys to employ over 4000 people selling beer, checking tickets, and providing security at an NFL football game on Thanksgiving day.

Black people get longer sentences than white people for committing the same crimes. I'm pretty sure most judges aren't hood wearing racists, so why does this happen? Somewhere in our sociological subconscious, we have an image of what a criminal is supposed to look like, so when the DA has to convince a judge or a jury that a person is a criminal, it's much easier to do when that person already looks like one. We also have these images of what a good student, hard worker and successful person looks like, and when they fail to fit into that mold they are given extra scrutiny.	Oh, I'm not denying that in many ways black people are discriminated against, that's a definite fact. But not all black people are affected by this discrimination and focusing only on 'let's give benefits to all black people' (I know that affirmative action doesn't work this way but that seems to be the common belief) ignores that several black people don't need the extra advantages, and several non-black people do. Also, I'm not sure about this, but I think it might be possible that the reason black people get longer sentences and more conviction rates is that we're so used to seeing black America as ghettos, poor, etc. in the media that we assume that all black people must be this way. So affirmative action in this case would just be covering up the real issues: That we need to work on improving these neglected communities.	0.6209363143949769	0.9182958340544896	3.333333333333333	1.3333333333333333	3.333333333333333	positive	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5362222	0.4718889	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	3	2	9	0.6666666666666666	expert	0

Despite the fact you walk past them and think their the scum of the earth they are people in their own right. Peoplr that despite their differences you have to consider, putting spikes to deter them isnt helping the problem its merely pushing it to the side. Ill probably get downvoted for this but when it comes to mens rights this an issue that needs to be addressed. Are males mire prone to alcoholism? Is it because we as males are prone to suppress our emotions?

cd9eji2	The concepts of supply and demand are the only concepts needed for this claim. I agree that lots of economics is up for debate, but microeconomics like supply and demand curves is not. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Binding-price-ceiling.svg	Sorry but that doesn't prove anything. Can you provide a conclusive proof that shows supply and demand always works correctly with human labor? While you agree that a lot of economics is up for debate, you seem to have missed that economics represents a pure math being tied (with varying degrees of success) to the real world. Considering some economists are very optimistic about rent ceilings, I cannot see how it's very objective that price ceiling on labor has that much of an effect. For one, the supply of people willing and capable of working those ceiling jobs far exceeds the demand (like it or not, there's quite a few middle managers with the expertise to run a big company, that simply won't get the chance). Who is getting the deadweight loss? People who are not willing to work for $1m/yr because it's not enough money. Where does that affect an economic cost? (except, perhaps, of businesses moving elsewhere solely for the top employee's benefit package...I doubt it'll be that common an event) And shortening the workweek would be a side-effect more than a goal of that.	0.9932695963304996	0.7642045065086203	3.0	1.8888888888888888	3.0	neutral	0.5555555555555556	6	0.5362222	0.4718889	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	3	4	2	9	0.7777777777777778	expert	0

There are a bunch of assumptions in that post I want to break down. The first is that technology usually leads to people being happier. Technology also has military uses, for one thing. In addition, do you think people are actually happier today than, say, 100, or even 20 years ago? Do you think technology has radically improved human happiness? Another question, how can you actually know if the short term costs are worth it, in that you can't know the future?

Even if it's perfectly secure to loan you money, I'm less well off with you having it right now. If for some reason I need that money *right now*, then I have to wait for you to return it to me.

cl6m2q1	Yes I can say that they aren't affected by the past wrongdoings. What from then affects black people negatively now?	Institutional racism- if it didn't effect them directly it certainly effected their parents. That means wherever they are economically, its less than where they should be. If they learn from their parents that white people aren't to be trusted then they are going to behave in different ways than if they consider themselves fully integrated into society. This effect isn't going to fade until everyone who was alive to experience it dies and then some. Slavery itself... every black family that is descended from slaves is at a huge disadvantage. They started from less than nothing. No one alive today went through that, obviously, but it has downstream effects on how parents raise their kids, their economic standing, and most importantly how they shape their kids beliefs about society. I am not trying to say that black people today are directly affected by slavery, of course they are not. But it was a huge cultural movement in this country and the effects that I mentioned won't go away overnight, especially since racism was still essentially legal as recently as 50 years ago. 	0.1741574829701307	0.9910760598382222	2.6666666666666665	1.4444444444444444	3.6666666666666665	positive	0.5555555555555556	5	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	2	9	0.5555555555555556	negative	0

While in this class we closely followed the daily weather and I've been following the weather since and comparing it to historical averages. The weather this year (at least for my area) has been extremely close to average this entire year. This combined with the decrease in natural disaster over the last two years and shrinking of desserts make me question how big a threat and how much we are underestimating our earth.

Whether we are simply in a global warming cycle or not, whether the changes are directly caused by humans or not, the global average temperature increase is undeniable. Although many technologically advanced populations will be able to adapt to those changes, less-developed groups are already living on the brink and simply don't have the resources/tech to overcome those changes. Pressure on resources like food and water might be more focused in the less-developed countries (although we are seeing droughts in historically ""safe"" regions), and those conflicts have a way of escalating, boiling over into larger conflicts. In short, regardless of the causation question, we are seeing historically high temperatures and severe storms; unless the trend reverses immediately, it will cause major pressure on food and water resources, leading to immediate loss of life in less-developed countries, political and military conflicts in many areas, and potentially incite major conflicts."	0.1741574829701307	0.9910760598382222	2.333333333333333	1.2222222222222223	3.7777777777777777	neutral	0.5555555555555556	5	0.5362222	0.4718889	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	2	0	9	0.5555555555555556	GPT	0

cnc8vcs	Every time you want to model a market, you start with the economic framework for it, and then add in a bunch of terms to correct for things. But the way that rich people act is a lot closer to idealized markets, because poor people are disproportionately affected by the infinite number of hidden costs that exist in reality that cannot be taken into account in economics. In fluid dynamics, there's a hard break between laminar and turbulent flow. Neither describe reality. They are 2 ways of looking at the exact same thing, and you change between the 2 as needed. They have fundamentally different mathematical assumptions about how liquids behave. It would be equivalent to if, in economics, they said while analyzing this real-world situation, rather than call it a market with agents, etc., we're going to call it a trading post and assume that the primary effect is determined by information. The Economics does a bit of this, as in game theory, some of behavioral economics, and macro. However, those are all essentially agnostic about the poor and don't make up for the bias inherent in standard economic models.	I'm still not seeing how this amounts to bias. Simplifying assumptions do not entail negatively judging situations where those assumptions break down. Nor is it inappropriate to characterize those complications by the assumptions that no longer hold (i.e. saying poor people are poor in part because they lack information). To use your analogy, someone who studies laminar flow isn't biased against turbulence and can fairly point to how turbulence results from certain kinds of violations of laminar assumptions.	0.9957363438489084	0.9709505944546686	3.3	2.1	3.8	neutral	1.0	7	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	1	3	10	0.6	GPT	0

cf516ty	I Don't believe the world would be an even marginally better place were religion removed from it. I Believe humans to be a naturally somewhat sadistic species, and I think we would find excuses to be violent with or without religion. Yes, people throughout history have been brutally killed because of religious dogma, but often it goes deeper than that. Take the Conquest of Mexico for example. Even if the Spanish had all been staunch atheists, they still would have invaded Mexico, still sparked a bloody war, still killed thousands. Why? Gold of course! Having no religion doesn't diminish human greed. Even the crusades, often cited as the prime example of what religious dogma and ignorance can cause, has another layer. Yes, it was conducted under the pretenses of a Holy War, but what else do you gain by seizing Palestine, besides pleasing God? That's right, all that sweet pilgrim money, not to mention trade from the east. So no, religion doesn't cause wars, it just provides an excuse for people to start wars.

cj5pf24	FGM is done to control a woman's sexual behaviour through adulthood. Circumcision is not. What they have in common is that they're procedures that physically mutilate the person's genitals, but that's where the similarity ends.	Actually in America the practice of infant male circumcision began for the exact same reason. To ignore this is what appears wrong to me.

It would seem to me that even if it was widely agreed that climate change was not a threat to humanity, the benefits of such practices would still be rather obvious. Even if coal and oil were the most abundant things on the planet, renewable energy (particularly solar) seems to have the most potential for reducing energy costs in the future. Even if pollution was incapable of causing a world wide catastrophe, it's still a bad thing and worth reducing. can someone at least help me understand the logic of the opposition of this?

Nih-kar-ah-gooah or knee-hala-gooah for Nicaragua. On the one hand there is objectively a correct pronunciation for the name and if you aren't following it, you're just wrong. On the other hand, once the incorrect pronunciation is popularised and everyone knows what you are saying, you look like at douche correcting people. I had a professor tell me that he uses the anglicised pronunciation of countries (not Americanised) at conferences because foreigners accept that we will use it and expect it from us anyways. I think the same goes for gifs.	I definitely get your point. But I think the comparisons to names of countries is a little bit different because it can lead to passion, hurt feelings, and offensiveness.

clouoep	Pork, is by far the most versatile of meats. It has more variety than any other animal can offer. The ears can be used for dog treats. The shoulder is used for pulled pork and similar dishes. The arms can be used for sausage. The loin can be used for roasts or dishes like pork chops. There are both spare and baby back ribs. Hind legs are what we consider to be ham (whether lunch meat or ham steaks). What's important here is just how different all these parts are and the resulting dishes.

ccwv7d7	I don't think election campaigns should be a thing, whether it's on a local level or a national level. Millions of dollars are spent on what are essentially empty promise machines. Candidates take anywhere from a month to a year to twist facts, hold ridiculous rallies holding only die-hard supporters, talk in massive generalities about the way their opposition is ruining the electorate and how they'd fix it, and promise everything from a pony for every citizen to a space base on Mars. I think they're a huge waste of money, time, and energy, and they enable the more charming to win over the more capable. I envision a system where each party submits their policies and beliefs to an independent third-party that then creates a document or booklet that compares each choice with the other, so each constituent can make up their own mind without being swayed by ponies.	&>> each party submits their policies and beliefs to an **independent** third-party Ay, there's the rub. Independence is a really complicated concept which is hard to even pin down theoretically, let alone actually achieve in real life.

To make this system work, we need to figure out a way of setting things up so that the pamphlet-maker is a) competent to understand and convey the political platforms of the candidates, and b) can be trusted not to 'fail' at the above task on purpose, even if someone makes it worth his while to do so. And if you can come up with a reliable system which meets these requirements to elect a pamphlet-maker for the election, why not skip the election and use this reliable system of yours to appoint good leaders to office in the first place?	0.9999701141674332	0.7219280948873623	2.9	1.3	4.5	neutral	1.0	5	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	5	3	2	10	0.8	expert	0

clgnmud	"I'm not from Western Europe but I've seen on reddit and also while living in France that people seem to still be quite obsessed with WW2 and keep the same mentality as if the war had ended 2 years and not 70 years ago. The nazis were evil, those fighting against them were heroes. You must believe that nazism was the worse thing that ever happend in history, otherwise you're a nazi apologist so you're evil. I believe nazism isn't inherently evil, it's an ideology that had its place in that moment of history, nationalism, antisemitism and the belief that the white race is superior were very common beliefs during the 19th and beginning of 20th century. Also, the atrocities that the German army commited are similar to those commited by other armies in other wars. The only reason why nazism is seen as the symbol of evil nowadays is because the US fought against them in WW2 and the US wants an image of ""saviors of the world"". So basically, the whole western world is still under influence of war propaganda from 70 years ago and can't consider nazism with objectivity. CMV"	I agree that the Red Army were largely un disciplined animals, the Nazi's being disciplined but genocidal in there eastern conquest, Imperial Japan exterminating and raping more Chinese people than the Germans did to Jews; however could you source England, Canada or the US GI's exterminating towns, mass rape or slaughtering POW's.

cf5z5t5	The odds of my vote changing the result of any election on a federal lever, or even changing a politicians opinion of the national mood (what the people want) are so astronomically small that the time it takes me to vote (about 20 minutes where I live, much longer in some areas) that it is not with it to vote. I make around 25$ an hour meaning it costs me about 8$ in time to vote. The chances of my vote making a difference are about 1 in 60 million (http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/the-odds-that-your-vote-will-make-a-difference/). The odds of winning the Powerball lottery are 1 in 175 million, and a that only costs $2, and winning the lottery would affect my life *much greater* then deciding who becomes president one election. They say the lottery is a tax on people who can't do math, well I say the same thing for voting. I'm not saying that I don't want everyone to vote, I very much want that. How else are politicians going to be held accountable if no one votes? But I am not everyone, and for me personally, voting is not worth it. CMV. 	What about on a local level? Here are some initiatives on local ballots that effect raising or lowering the income tax in local areas: http://ballotpedia.org/Local_income_tax_on_the_ballot Now 1) the odds of you effecting a local vote is much higher. 2) the raising of income tax in your area would easily cost you more then 8 dollars. So if you agree that you should vote on a local level then the cost to vote on a state/federal level is very minuscule considering you'd only be saving a couple extra seconds by not voting when you already have the ballot in front of you. 	0.9999989292911888	0.4689955935892812	2.7	1.1	4.3	neutral	1.0	5	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	8	1	1	10	0.9	negative	0
cdayqnw	It is my belief that nobody, except perhaps the Christians, have any use for the so called 'holidays' anymore. That goes for all holidays--Arbor Day, President's Day, Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas to name a few. I believe (and have for several years now) that the only reason we still have most, if not all, holidays on the calendar as public holidays anymore is because it gives retailers an excuse to have a sale and people an excuse to go spend money. I believe that if the holidays were to disappear off the calendar forever, nobody save perhaps the Christians, would notice and/or care. The holidays used to MEAN something but they don't anymore, especially Thanksgiving. Retailers are opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving weekend because they say customers demand it and if they didn't, they'd lose money. I don't believe that's necessarily true in anybody's mind but the retailer's. CMV. If you can.	I'm going to use Christmas as an example here, as it's a holiday with a lot of social &amp; commerical capital. It never really had a singular meaning, it stemmed from a Roman Festival, Saturnalia and then was influenced by a bevy of Germanic traditions, before finally being mixed with a number of christian practices and reified into the holiday we all know. Was Christmas, at any point, more or less meaningful? Was it more true to early germanic pagans than it was to romans who just wanted to give each other gifts and get plastered? Of course not and while holidays don't have a single, monolithic meaning that exists in perpetuity, that doesn't mean that holidays can't mean a lot to the people who continue to practice them. For me, shopping and buying gifts isn't a big part of how I say, expierence Christmas, it's just when I spend time with family and unwind.	0.9999989292911888	0.4689955935892812	2.9	1.1	4.2	neutral	1.0	5	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	2	1	10	0.9	expert	0
cegcjhm	"So to start I do not whole heartedly believe this, but as time has passed this is what I have observed. It starts in high school with Jocks, and popular guys. They get the girls (good looking ones or any girl they want), move on to college same thing (popular frat guys and college athletes), and finally in the real world high end businessmen, athletes and anyone remotely successful. It would seem to me that most women are more interested in how they will appear to be with someone rather than actually being in love. I do recognize that there are marriages that are from true love, but I think they are the outliers to the situation. Clarification: This is based on how many women are attracted to these individuals and how ""good looking"" they are. (Women I am not trying to be an asshole here, just unbiased, I understand there are more to people then physical looks) (Part of this view may stem that I played hockey/soccer in high school, and that I am currently in college fraternity), but please CMV! "	You have two points here that aren't the same thing. 1) Attraction is a result of social prominence. 2) Women are more interested in how they will appear to be with someone rather than actually being in love. To your first point, well yeah....you can only be attracted to people you even notice in the first place. Men who have a a lot of social capital, then, have the spotlight on them. It's much easier to notice the loud, charismatic dude at the center of the party than the quiet, bookish dude staying in at the library. And that's not some sociological thing...the loud dude is just...fuckin' loud, man. How do you not notice him? Likewise with sports stars, musicians, etc. etc. Because of these men's increased visibility, it's easier for women to decide whether or not they're attracted to them. tl;dr: More time in the spotlight = more visibility = more opportunities for judgment = greater likelihood someone will find you attractive. To your second point, I'd argue that it's not an issue of women finding high visibility men attractive BECAUSE OF their status; they find high visibility men attractive because they find them.

I however disagree. Assuming that the law was a reasonable law that got removed because our society changed to such an extent that we no longer need the law the people who broke such a law should be jailed solely for the fact that they ignored the law. Examples of similar scenarios would be someone getting fined for driving 60 on a road who's speed limit was 30 but later the limit rose to 60. Or someone getting fined for j-walking on a place that later added a crosswalk. In those cases I think that most people would agree with me that those people should not get their money returned.

cfau6kk	It doesn't matter if you believe morality is absolute. You're wrong. Here's why: If morality is absolute, then all actions carry a moral weight. Why? Because if all actions do not necessarily carry a moral weight, then each action must be defined as carrying a moral weight or not carrying a moral weight. Does drinking water carry a moral weight? Yes or no? If the answer is no, why not? What if it is the last bit of water and drinking it causes another to dehydrate and die? Are you guilty of murder? What if you needed that water too? You cannot define every action as moral/immoral/amoral. Each action depends on its circumstance and context. Moral absolutism is bullshit. It is not a legitimate theory to anyone with a brain. Sorry, but you're just wrong.	You cannot define every action as moral/immoral/amoral. Each action depends on its circumstance and context. Moral absolutism is bullshit. Yes, you can. Even if every action depends on its circumstance and context, you still define them as moral/immoral/amoral. Whether or not you look at actions with context or not, you still make a moral judgment about them. Your argument here doesn't support your conclusion. You say that you can't define every action, but your next sentence says that each action depends on its circumstance and context. But what exactly is being depended on? The chosen course of action? If so, why are you choosing that particular action? Each action you chose, you chose because you believe it is either the moral action, or that it doesn't matter. You can never chose an immoral action, because you can't ever truly believe you are making the wrong decision (otherwise you wouldn't make it). Thus, every action you take you are saying is the correct action for that specific situation, which is absolutist in its own way. 	0.9999989292911888	0.4689955935892812	3.0	1.6	4.2	neutral	1.0	7	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	2	2	10	0.9	expert	0

cjum739	For every song with a positive message like 'Keep ya head up' or 'Changes', he's got 10 more that glorify gang violence and shootings. The idea that he was non-violent is totally at odds with the music he actually made. A brief glance at his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#Personal_life) will also show you that he was an exceptionally violent person: He assaulted another rapper with a baseball bat in 1993, and assaulted a film director in 1994. In both cases he plead guilty. He was also found guilty of gang raping a woman in a hotel, a crime for which he was sent to prison. With anybody else, those three crimes would be enough to judge someone as an extremely violent and unsafe person highly unsuited to be a role model for anybody, but for some reason he's earned a reputation for being some kinda hip-hop gandhi. There are plenty of legendary rappers like Mos Def, Nas and Andre 3000 whose positive messages are overlooked in favour of Tupac, despite managing to avoid assaulting or raping people. The fact that Tupac garners as much respect as he does is symptomatic of massive immaturity in certain parts of the hip-hop community.	"Well it's hard to look back now at the guy and have one single opinion, especially since Tupac, in his current iteration, is not *really* Tupac from way back when. Rappers from his generation straddled old school rap and gangster rap, and were popular *because* of that. More to the point, unlike certain modern ""rappers,"" people from Tupac's ilk actually were growing up in the oft-decried decline of black culture; a time associated with skyrocketing narcotics usage and the degradation of the classical family home. To be a kid growing up in this, this would be tough. For Tupac it was clearly something that required you to (in his perception) join to survive. That, of course, is not to say that anything he did in a gang, or anything anyone does in a gang/criminal nature, is acceptable, it's simply to say that these people were in a place where the gang culture was beginning to take hold.

cmgl19r	I agree with all the points you make, and I think the way you have made them is very appropriate. However, you are working with a less rigorous definition of knowledge, as you seem to be aware. If the reasoning in the OP cannot be refuted, then we might be forced to adopt a less rigorous definition of knowledge. The definition I am trying to debate is the rigorous one, though.	In your defence, nearly every working definition of knowledge in modern epistemology lists truth as a necessary condition for knowledge. The trouble with this condition is that we can claim no certainty in whether our belief has verified this condition. Meaning that if knowledge is possible, there is no belief that you can be justified in claiming is knowledge, even if it is knowledge. So not only are you committed to a less rigorous definition of knowledge, but you're also committed to a less rigorous definition of what constitutes a met condition.	0.99999385832488	0.7219280948873623	2.3	1.2	3.5	neutral	1.0	6	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	5	2	3	10	0.8	GPT	0
ckucxei	No, like I said, the delivery area is very large, and we have a lot of drivers. (maybe 10 on a typical night, more on weekends/holidays). With such a large area, and so many drivers, we often don't deliver to the same houses often enough to really remember who's the best tipper. Even if we did, that's not how we do things. This is a big chain I work at, not some local shop. We aren't allowed to stop at gas stations to get cigarettes. That's a good way for me to get fired. (or maybe a couple warnings first). If I'm taking two runs, I deliver to whoever placed their order first. (Unless the other one is like right across the street from the store, which for some reason people do order delivery from instead of walking for 2 minutes lol.) That's just policy, and it makes sense. If I deliver to whoever I think will tip better, the other person maybe have to wait an hour - hour and a half or even more to get their pizza. That's just completely unfair, and another way to get a lot of complaints, lose customers, etc. 	"&>> With such a large area, and so many drivers, we often don't deliver to the same houses often enough to really remember who's the best tipper Even though you're in a ""large"" area, you will definitely remember over time. &>> If I deliver to whoever I think will tip better, the other person maybe have to wait an hour - hour and a half or even more to get their pizza.

cemc106	I have a limited understanding of finance so I could be entirely wrong here. But I feel like Bitcoin the commodity and Bitcoin the currency create a problem for eachother. As Bitcoin becomes accepted by retailers its value has shot up immensely. But this volatility ultimately makes it more difficult to use as a currency, because the value of bitcoin paid for something today could be much higher in another year or so. So this makes retailers wary of it, perhaps even causing some of them to drop it, which will make the value plummet, give it more of a reputation for being volatile, and cause a snowballing collapse of the currency. Change My View Reddit.	I also wondered about this but consider this simple fact: The rate of retail adoption has increased exponentially, despite major price fluctuations over the last five years.

cew9n4l	I understand that some people have reasons they do not want their organs taken after they die, I think it's stupid, but it's their right regardless and I don't want to infringe on that right. So all those people could opt-out of organ donoring for whatever reason, but I think by default everyone should be considered an organ donor until they choose to opt-out. This would save countless lives and I don't really see any downside to it, but as it's opt-in most everywhere in the world, I guess there has to be some reason, so do CMV.	I agree with the sentiment, but studies have shown that more people will choose to donate when it's opt-in than when it's opt-out. In which case, given that you want more people to donate, you should be pro-opt-out. Sounds weird, but it does kinda make sense, I think. Many people resent being automatically opted in to something so personal and choose to opt out, whereas many people given the option to do something good by simply checking a box will do so.

cd1i5ge	I realize that 'discriminate' is a charged word and want to specify that I'm only using it the sense of charging a different price. The basis of any insurance is pricing of risks. If one lives in a home in a flood-prone area, that person's flood insurance premium will be higher than for someone who lives on a hill. Health insurance is no different - premiums must be determined by the likelihood of someone using medical services and the cost of those services. It just so happens that women have more intricate inner workings then men and thus require more frequent 'maintenance'. This generally means more frequent doctor visits (which, not surprisingly, cost money). This should translate to higher insurance premiums. Disallowing to charge women a higher price results in men subsidizing women for services that men don't use. Sex discrimination in other areas is completely appropriate. Men pay more for car insurance due to the mere fact that they are men. Data shows that men are more likely to get in an accident and therefore cost more to insure. No surprise there, either. Same principle must apply to health insurance. CMV	If you view healthcare as a fundamental human right, then it makes no sense to discrimate use of that right because of something that is out of one's control. I think it makes sense to not allow any sort of discrimination based on age, race, sex, etc things that one is born as, rather than lifestyle choices. As to car insurance, I don't know what the argument for that as a fundamental human right would be...	0.9999957419159248	0.7219280948873623	3.0	1.4	3.5	neutral	1.0	5	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	6	4	0	10	0.8	negative	0

Further, minimum wage jobs are not only done by people who use it as their sole source of income - students who still live with their parents often work these jobs to gain skills and spending money. Those who want to earn a wage they can live off of should cultivate a skill or skills that allow them to be paid more. **Edit**: from the [bureau of labor statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm): &>>Minimum wage workers tend to be young.

This may be extreme to say but many leaders controlled their subjects by indoctrinating children. I get this is not on the same level as that but again, every morning (starting at the age of 5) I pledged my life to a government when I could not understand what I was actually saying.

cgbzi6m	The entire and only purpose of human morality is to enable humans to live in a society together. Period. That's all that this function evolved for, there's no reason to extend to anything else, whatsoever. Non-human animals have no relevance to human morality any more than humans are relevant to whatever morality has evolved in herd animals to enable them to gain the benefits of being social creatures. The only reason that some animals might be relevant to human morality would be if it is relevant to our living with other humans. E.g. if most humans the in the society believe it is immoral to eat dogs, then it is immoral, because if you violate this norm you will have difficulty living with other humans in that culture. 	I think you'll find there are philosophers who disagree. I'm not trying to tell you not to feel this way, but your degree of certainty is troubling. Many moral philosophers would contend that morality is about the experience of conscious beings of all kinds, not just humans. There are lots of different interpretations of morality.

cj3ljf9	Being demonstrably cheaper is basically the evidence I've been lacking. According to USDA FNS, cost breakdown of school lunch is about 45% food, 45% labor, 10% supplies and indirect costs. I'd just like to see stats that confirm that 55% labor and overhead truly counterbalances a proportionally higher decentralized food cost. Some schools are opting out of the National Lunch Program because it's gotten too costly and/or wasteful as paying students reject the options being offered by the schools. I'm just growing more skeptical as school lunches continue to require greater subsidizing to keep low-income kids fed.	Cost of goods sold includes labor as part of the standard definition. If a school does not have a well integrated lunch system or are expected to provide additional free meals without an offsetting source of revenue then this would not be the case. Additionally cost advantages of buying in bulk can easily be negated by waste if the recipes or quality of preparation are lacking. Those are the schools that are opting out.

cbhmm6h	About 40-67% of marijuana in the United States (and over 90% of cocaine) come from the drug cartels in Mexico (and some parts of Central and South America). These cartels commit unspeakable acts of violence and cruelty, often targeting innocent civilians and children. Not to mention that they sell severely addictive and dangerous drugs. So if you're only buying weed from them, you're still funding an operation that distributes crystal meth and black-tar heroin, both of which cause enormous harm to their users. Yet my liberal friends seem to have no problem buying drugs that put money in the hands of these brutal organizations. I agree that the US government should legalize marijuana (and maybe all drugs) in order to hurt the cartels. However, they have not, and regardless that does not justify giving money to the cartels. I just don't understand how supposedly ethical people can do something like this. Just to be clear, I'm obviously not referring to people who buy weed grown in the United States (or grown by some other non-cartel operation), but the vast majority comes from the cartels. CMV.	Drug markets are static- they will exist regardless of any restrictions or disincentives that are put in place. This fact can't be denied, especially in the case of addictive drugs like methamphetamine. Once someone is hooked they have a biological imperative to seek the drug that overrides any moral or ethical reasons not to. Addiction is a medical issue, not a moral one. The fact that violent cartels have come to be top dogs in the drug market is not the fault of the consumers, it's the fault of the restrictions themselves. Non-criminal enterprises are barred from engaging in the drug trade, meaning that criminal organizations are the only ones who are able to take advantage of the market. Additionally, people are solely responsible for their own actions. If a ruthless murderer decides to make money off of drugs, that doesn't mean it's his customer's fault he is a murderer. 	0.9999957419159248	0.7219280948873623	2.5	1.3	4.3	neutral	1.0	6	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	8	1	1	10	0.8	expert	0
cdif4bv	"Alright, so you say ""choosing"" to reproduce is not equated with the genetic urge to reproduce. That there is no significance to be found in the connection. But you also claim that people are not brave enough to take their lives under extreme hardship because of the genetic urge for self-preservation. Making the conscious choice to reproduce is an action predicated by genetic ""coding"" in much the same way that the conscious choice to not commit suicide is predicated by genetic ""coding"". You can't logically hold one view without the other. Also, don't forget to respond to our original train of thought below - that one is more important in my opinion and will become more related to your original question!"	I'm making a distinction between rational choice and the emotional drives that affect our better judgement. Your ability to choose what you do isn't predicated on your genetics. It is distinct on the basis that you make it on moral and ideological grounds that are at best only indirectly affected by your personal biochemistry. The difference between right and wrong isn't hard wired into our genes, it's passed on in the form of memetic information.	0.9996706007335782	0.9709505944546686	3.6	1.3	3.8	neutral	1.0	5	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	7	1	2	10	0.6	GPT	0
cpp8uhl	"Shouldn't it be assumed, by this point, that all statements concerning value (not including ""objective"" facts) and/or beliefs are subject to scrutiny and that the only reason people tell others, ""That's just, like, your opinion man,"" is to reinforce the belief in some kind of epistemological skepticism and completely unnecessary?

cp3jn3k	If unpaid internships were illegal, then it wouldn't have led to this rampant nonsense of all entry level positions requiring work experience because the companies can pre-select for someone who worked for free.	Again, for me personally, in the arts, my internships have been about meeting people who are already successful in art. My work experience won't do much for me as far as far as getting a job, but knowing some of the people I've met will. I'm in a better position because of my unpaid internships, and they wouldn't have existed if they were required to be paid. Many fields do pay, unfortunately for me they're typically fields where the intern is going to make a fair bit of money at a real job too. Taking away unpaid internships might improve the situation for some, but I think in other fields it would only serve to harm the students/people who want the experience.	0.9999839707175336	0.8812908992306927	3.5	1.1	3.6	positive	1.0	7	0.44950002	0.4532	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	8	1	1	10	0.7	GPT	0

cfpl4ns	First, I just want to point out that I am not a fan of celebrity gossip and all that and I prefer to pay attention to pressing world issues. However, in America, we have such a thing called freedom of press. While freedom of press might have originally been created so that we could have the freedom to criticize our government, to me, it means that the news and magazines can choose to focus on whatever stories they want, whether they address the Syrian conflict or whatever new fashion trends Katie Perry is following. Besides, who are you to tell someone that they can't choose to read something that is superficial if they enjoy following superficial topics? Maybe it is better if we are all informed about what is going on in the world, but I believe we must make the active choice to do so ourselves, rather than force others into doing so. 	"People care about what their peers care about. Societies choose what their values are as a group by expressing their values to each other. If you believe that society would benefit if people cared and informed themselves about ""hard news"", then telling other people so is how you change the culture of the society to make it happen. In essence, there is nothing wrong in the abstract about what you are talking about. Telling other people that hard news is more important, and they should care about it, is how cultures and societies change so that they honestly *do*. It's how you create an environment that allows people to change their own opinions more easily. You may have a problem with doing it in an asshole way, but that's being an asshole, and has nothing to do with the topic itself.

cgtad17	I walked by a guy in a short skirt here in Seattle. He was wearing cosmetic eye contacts that made his eyes look inhuman, and he gave me an unusual glare as I walked by. This made me feel unsafe in a number of ways. Claiming that this type of behavior doesn't affect other people is grossly short-sighted. I believe history repeats itself because people will always behave the same. The LGBT groups will continue to claim acceptance and equality for all people, but are simply developing their own dogmas and ultimately their own bias toward other social groups.
